Capability `via` lists in design/frob.strata only ever grow. When a new file starts writing to disk, the fix is to append it to the fs.write list, and nothing anywhere pushes back. The self-model therefore documents an ever-loosening posture while looking green the whole time.

Add a ratchet: a via list may SHRINK freely, but growing it requires an explicit, recorded justification -- the same posture the repo already applies to waivers (a reason plus a follow-up), and the same one-way discipline T-1575's profile auto-ratchet uses (tighten automatically, loosen only by deliberate act).

Mechanically: record each capability's declared site count in the baseline the gates already keep; fail when a count increases without an accompanying justification attribute on that declaration; pass silently when it decreases.

This is what converts the capability model from documentation into enforcement. Today a developer who adds an exec call in a new file gets a SYS finding, appends the file, and moves on -- the gate taught them the ritual for widening the boundary rather than making them argue for it.

Report, as part of this ticket, the current per-capability site counts so there is a baseline to ratchet from and a number to drive down later.
