`frob.graph.callgraph.scope_private_helper_gaps` (T-0998, SCOPE002
direction 5) narrows its `build_call_graph` candidate set to files sharing
a scoped file's PARENT DIRECTORY. For a flat top-level directory like
`tests/` (hundreds of files, one dir), this degrades to "every test file
in the whole tests/ tree" the moment any single test file is in scope --
observed live: scoping `tests/test_graph.py` alone produced 4000+ SCOPE002
"review the dependency" findings, almost all naming a same-named `_write`/
`_run` helper private to some unrelated sibling test file, not a real
under-capture signal.

WARN-only (never blocks), so this is noise, not a correctness bug -- but
noisy enough that a real agent would tune it out entirely rather than
read the real hits buried in it. Needs a narrower per-scope candidate-set
heuristic for large flat directories (e.g. cap candidate file count, or
require the SAME leaf-name collision to be genuinely ambiguous before
flagging, or scope the search to files matching the ticket's own SOURCE
directory conventions rather than a raw parent-dir match) before this
direction is trustworthy enough to read routinely. Filed instead of fixed
under T-0998's own scope/effort budget.
