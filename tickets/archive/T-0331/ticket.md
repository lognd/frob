Complete the system-design linter with what a senior systems/reliability engineer checks -- over the .strata MODEL (nodes/flows/boundaries/stores), each a real static obligation, SYS2xx/REL2xx family. CATALOG:
Reliability: TIMEOUT on every remote/cross-boundary flow (unbounded hang otherwise); RETRY must declare exponential backoff+jitter, and no retry on a non-idempotent op; IDEMPOTENCY key required on a mutating op reachable by a retryable flow (duplicate effects); CIRCUIT BREAKER / bulkhead per external dependency (extends LINT004 kill-switch); FALLBACK / graceful degradation declared for a CRITICAL dependency; HEALTH liveness+readiness on every service node; SPOF -- a node with inbound critical flows and replicas_max=1/no redundancy; BACKPRESSURE bounded intake on queues/consumers (extends LINT003 surge / LINT005 capacity).
Observability: every boundary flow emits metrics+traces+logs; CORRELATION/trace-id propagated across a flow chain (distributed tracing); golden-signal SLOs (latency/traffic/errors/saturation) + error budget declared per service.
Data/consistency: SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (two nodes writing one store = hazard; extends SYS003 hub); transactional boundary on multi-write ops; MESSAGE SCHEMA VERSION on events/queues (backward-compat); exactly-once vs at-least-once declared on queues; retention/TTL on PII stores (ties T-0207).
Distributed: SYNC CALL-CHAIN DEPTH bound (cascading latency/failure; uses reachability incl. non-transitive T-0282); distributed txn across services requires saga/compensation; no shared mutable state across service boundaries; clock/ordering assumptions (T-0282).
Each is a strata surface addition (new node/flow attrs) + a checker + litmus + docs, deny-by-default with a reasoned waive channel (T-0174). COINCIDENCE with arch: strata reasons over the MODEL (flows/nodes); arch reasons over CODE (functions). Where they touch (observability, error handling), the code check BACKS the system claim via the capability/binding graph -- one obligation, checked at the right level, never duplicated.

## PROVABILITY CONSTRAINT (user, 2026-07-19 -- non-negotiable)
strata's job is NOT model-only lint. Its purpose is to PROVE the actual CODE conforms to
the .strata system design, the way a type-checker proves code matches its types. The
existing bridge is capability self-conformance (SYS100 undeclared-capability-in-code,
SYS101 declared-but-never-observed, SYS102 unmodeled-code). EVERY new systems obligation
here MUST preserve this: an obligation is satisfied ONLY by one of --
  (a) PROOF AGAINST CODE: the code is analyzed and shown to match the declared property
      (e.g. a flow declaring timeout=T must have an actual timeout arg at the real call
      site; a node declaring a fallback must have the fallback path in code; a declared
      retry-backoff must match the code's retry loop; declared observability must have the
      instrumentation). This reuses arch's code analysis + the capability/binding graph.
  (b) PROOF AGAINST MODEL: the kernel model-checks it structurally (reach/noflow/isolation).
  (c) EXPLICIT REASONED DISCHARGE: an assume/waive (T-0174) with a written reason + ticket,
      when the code cannot be statically shown -- NEVER a silent pass.
NO obligation may be satisfied by bare declaration in the .strata file alone. FOUNDATIONAL
DEPENDENCY: proof-against-code is only sound if the code analysis is sound -- an evadable
scanner (grep) makes SYS100 unsound (exec via an alias slips the proof). So T-0328
(import/binding-aware resolution) underpins this whole epic; the code<->model proof is only
as trustworthy as the resolver. This is the arch<->strata coincidence in full: arch analyzes
code STRUCTURE; strata PROVES code CONFORMS to the declared system model, USING arch's
analysis + the capability graph as the evidence.

ADVERSARIAL HARDENING (2026-07-20, see docs/design/structural-linter-adversarial-hardening.md): the anti-evasion structure is CONFORMANCE TOTALITY (epic T-0341): coverage totality (every capable module binds to a node), EXACT interface conformance (declared interface == real public surface), a PURPOSE contract (purpose carries an allowed-effect profile), binding totality (no laundering logic into an unbound file), effect conformance with opaque effects FAILING CLOSED (T-0339), and bounded/staleness-gated assumes+waivers with an un-droppable floor view. 'No obligation by bare declaration' is made TOTAL: the model cannot be dangerous-and-silent.

EXHAUSTIVENESS DRIFT-LOCK (T-0343, 2026-07-20 mandate 'implementation MUST address EVERYTHING the exhaustive researcher found'): this epic's implementation binds to the corpus DENOMINATOR MANIFEST via T-0343's N:M coverage meta-test. Denominator source: system-design-corpus.md (the entries tagged strata-checkable). Every relevant manifest entry must map to >=1 registered check/obligation/recommender-rule OR carry an explicit reasoned deferral (advisory/not-checkable/ticketed); (addressed union deferred) == TOTAL. The epic CANNOT close while any researched entry is un-addressed and un-deferred -- the corpora (docs/design/*) are the enforceable denominator, not just reading.
