Discovered incidentally while closing T-0556 (unrelated ticket) in a worktree that had already closed T-0567/T-0545/T-0552/T-0547 earlier in the same branch: symbols touched by T-0545/T-0552 (e.g. src/frob/gates/_coverage.py::stamp_coverage, src/frob/gates/__init__.py::_test005/test_gate/_edge_has_execution_evidence/_KNOWN_GATE_RULES/_COVERAGE_LOCK_REL) started failing COV002 again -- 'changed with no frob:ticket edge to an open ticket' -- even though each carries a valid frob:ticket T-0545/T-0552 directive and both tickets' closures are still part of the same uncommitted diff against main (git diff main --stat still shows all the intervening commits). This reproduces with a bare frob check (no --ticket override), so it is not scoped to T-0556's own diff content -- it appeared sometime between T-0552's own clean check (frob check --ticket T-0552 showed 0 COV errors right after closing it) and starting T-0556's ticket workflow (multiple frob ticket scope/sweep operations on tickets.md in between). Hypothesis: _bound_to_open_ticket's grace-window hunk-matching (docs/audits or __init__.py:1917 _bound_to_open_ticket docstring, T-0214/T-0320) depends on a ticket's DONE-transition marker line falling within a single git diff hunk against main; repeated tickets.md rewrites by later ticket operations (scope changes, sweeps, done-report writes for OTHER tickets) can split/relocate that hunk so an EARLIER ticket's own close marker no longer registers as 'in this diff's tickets.md hunk' even though the closure commit is still, in aggregate, part of the diff vs main. Needs investigation: reproduce minimally (two sequential ticket closes in one branch, then a third ticket's ledger operations), confirm the hunk-boundary hypothesis, and either make the grace window robust to intervening unrelated tickets.md hunks or make COV002's message clearer that this is a hunk-shape artifact, not a real missing edge. Related: docs/guides/agent-playbook.md section 10b's existing multi-ticket-worktree warnings (about ledger finalization) -- this is a parallel failure mode in the SAME class of hazard, but for COV002 rather than the Done-report/close ledger writes.

## Failure log
- 2026-07-23 attempt 1: Could not reproduce the hunk-splitting regression after three escalating real-diff repro attempts (sequential closes, interleaved scope noise, 40 near-identical tickets); grace window held in every case. See Done report for full detail.
