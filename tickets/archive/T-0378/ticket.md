Extend binding-aware resolution to Rust: resolve 'use' aliases (as-renames) and path resolution so `use std::process::Command as C` still resolves to the dangerous capability, mirroring Python's scope-shadowing discipline (a local binding of the same name must NOT false-positive). Acceptance: aliased use-import still caught; local shadow not caught; adversarial tests added.

T-4718 sweep (condensed from src/frob/vet/_capability_c.py:31-61, trimmed
for DOCARCH002's 12-line cap): the trimmed block's full original text,
kept verbatim below.

# T-0379: import/binding-aware resolution for C/C++, the fourth binding
# resolver alongside T-0328 (python) / T-0377 (TS) / T-0378 (rust). C/C++'s
# dominant renaming idiom is the preprocessor, not an import system: `#define
# SYS system` makes `SYS("sh")` a call to `system` with no `"system("`
# substring anywhere in the file's own text, evading the raw-text needle
# scan the same way an aliased python `import`/rust `use` does. Only a
# SIMPLE object-like macro whose value is a single bare identifier is
# resolved (`#define SYS system`) -- a function-like macro (`#define SYS(x)
# system(x)`) is a `preproc_function_def` node, a structurally different
# shape, and is a documented, deliberately out-of-scope limitation here
# (mirrors the T-0378 grouped-`use` limitation note above): a function-like
# macro already re-expands to literal "system(" text at its call site in
# common usage, so the raw-text lexical scan still has a real (if weaker)
# chance at it, unlike the pure-rename case this resolver targets.
#
# A `using NAMESPACE::NAME;` declaration or namespace-qualified call site
# (`fs::system(...)` after `namespace fs = std;`) needs NO special
# resolution here: the registry's own needles are bare substrings
# (`"system("`), which still occur verbatim inside a qualified call --
# `_needle_hits_outside_comments` already catches those lexically. Type-only
# aliases (`typedef`/C++11 `using X = Y;` alias-declarations) do not rename
# a CALLABLE and are out of scope for the same reason.
#
# Shadow-awareness mirrors `_rust_shadowing_scope`'s POSITION-aware
# discipline (T-0378 round 2, T-0339 fail-closed): a local variable or
# function parameter sharing a macro alias's name must not have a call site
# textually BEFORE its own declaration wrongly treated as shadowed. Block
# scoping (nested `compound_statement` scopes each shadowing independently)
# is over-approximated to "the whole enclosing function" -- matching the
# python/rust resolvers' function-granularity, not per-block C scoping;
# documented, not a silent gap.

T-4718 sweep (condensed from src/frob/vet/_capability_kotlin.py:19-42,
trimmed for DOCARCH002's 12-line cap): the trimmed block's full original
text, kept verbatim below.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- kotlin (T-0664)
#
# Kotlin static-binding resolution (docs/design/capability-evasion-
# taxonomy.md's Kotlin table, T-0664 -- the fourth per-language resolver
# after T-0328/T-0377/T-0378/T-0379/T-0662/T-0663's python/TS/rust/C/C++
# ones). `frob.lang.raw_tree`'s `"kotlin"` label reaches `frob.lang._walk_
# kotlin`'s grammar via T-0723's central-dispatch wiring.
#
# SCOPE, disclosed up front rather than silently narrowed: this resolver
# uses a FLAT, FILE-WIDE alias table (no per-scope/position shadow
# discipline the way `_c_shadowing_scope`/`_rust_shadowing_scope` give the
# C/rust resolvers) -- a local variable that happens to share a name with
# an imported/aliased binding is NOT distinguished from the import here.
# This is a REDUCED-FIDELITY model versus the other four resolvers (a
# genuine over-approximation risk, not a silent gap: a shadowing local
# could theoretically cause a spurious "detected" on a name that is
# locally rebound to something harmless), accepted for this pass given
# kotlin's own grammar has no separate compilation-unit-vs-function-body
# scope split as clean as C's `_C_SCOPE_TYPES`/rust's `_RUST_SCOPE_TYPES`
# to hang position-aware bookkeeping off of without materially more
# machinery than this ticket's own time budget allows. A future pass
# tightening this to per-function scoping (mirroring `_c_scope_bound_
# names`'s shape against kotlin's `function_declaration`/`class_body`
# nodes) is a natural follow-up, not attempted here.
