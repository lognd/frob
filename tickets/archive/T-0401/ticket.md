See docs/audits/strata.md. HIGH: boundaries never bound to code (discharge = typing a matching string); vacuous discharge when foreign->sink flow is un-modeled (incomplete .strata discharges real caps); eval globally BenignCapability-excused (no RCE obligation); FOREIGN files loose under src/frob/ escape all SYS + THREAT004/005; utility flow marker defeats confidentiality noflow. RIGHT-WAY fix: join Boundary predicates against observed code; require flow-completeness before a NoFlow discharges (fail-closed); add eval obligation; make sys rules cover every capability-bearing file. Then re-audit until empty. G6-G12 in the doc.
