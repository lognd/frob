Follow-on to T-0328 (import/binding-aware resolver). T-0328 resolves import aliases (import X as Y, from X import Z as W) but does NO intraprocedural dataflow, so a LOCAL rebinding of an imported dangerous name evades the scan. Empirically (2026-07-20): 'from subprocess import run; xyz = run; xyz(["pwned"])' -> scan reports [] (MISS); chained 'a = run; b = a; b(...)' -> [] (MISS); while direct/import-as/from-as all correctly report exec. This is a soundness hole in strata's 'may' analysis -- the exact 'you cannot get around it' property the tool exists to guarantee. FIX: add a scope-local copy-propagation pass to _capability.py's resolver -- when an assignment binds a name to (a) an import-table entry, (b) an attribute access that resolves to a dangerous target, or (c) another local name already known to alias a dangerous target, record name -> resolved_target; then resolve calls through those aliases (transitively, cycle-guarded). Keep it SOUND for may-analysis (over-approximate: if a name is ever bound to a dangerous target in the scope, calls to it may be dangerous) but do NOT regress T-0328's shadowing guarantees (a name that is a parameter/local bound ONLY to a benign value, or shadows an import with a non-dangerous binding, must stay silent). Reuse _py_import_table / _py_scope_bound_names / _resolve_py_expr rather than duplicating. Add litmus tests for: single rebind, chained rebind, rebind-then-call-via-attribute, benign rebind (no FP), parameter shadow (no FP, T-0328 regression guard), and reassignment where a name is first dangerous then rebound benign (document the may-analysis over-approximation choice).

T-4718 sweep (condensed from
src/frob/vet/_capability_typescript_bindtable.py:18-147, trimmed for
DOCARCH002's 12-line cap): the trimmed block's full original text, kept
verbatim below.

# T-0377: import/binding-aware resolution for TypeScript/JS, mirroring the
# T-0328/T-0337 Python discipline above -- same shape (import/require/alias
# table + scope-shadowing over the same tree-sitter parse), different
# grammar. Before this, TS/JS capability scanning was pure lexical needle-
# matching over raw text, so any renamed/destructured/namespaced import to a
# dangerous module evaded it entirely: `import {run as r} from
# 'child_process'; r(cmd)` never contains the literal text "child_process"
# or "exec("/"run(" the needle table looks for at the call site; neither
# does `const {exec} = require('child_process'); exec(cmd)` or `import cp =
# require('child_process'); cp.exec(cmd)`.
#
# Import/require forms resolved into the binding table (`_ts_import_table`):
#   import {run as r} from 'child_process'   -> {"r": "child_process.run"}
#   import * as cp from 'child_process'      -> {"cp": "child_process"}
#   import dflt from 'child_process'         -> {"dflt": "child_process"}
#   import cp = require('child_process')     -> {"cp": "child_process"}
#   const {exec} = require('child_process')  -> {"exec": "child_process.exec"}
#   const cp = require('child_process')      -> {"cp": "child_process"}
#
# Scope-awareness (mandatory to avoid FALSE POSITIVES, mirrors T-0328): a
# function/method PARAMETER, or a local `const`/`let`/`var` binding, of the
# same name as an imported binding SHADOWS it in every enclosing scope from
# the site up to the module (`program`) root -- `function g(run){ run(x); }`
# must not resolve `run` to a dangerous import. A property access on an
# unrelated object (`class Job { run(){} }` then `new Job().run()`) never
# even reaches the import table: the object side of that member expression
# is a `new_expression`/`call_expression`, not a resolvable identifier/
# member chain, so resolution stops there by construction -- same posture
# as `Job().run()` in the Python resolver.
#
# T-0377 REVIEWER ROUND 2 (two live evasion classes the round-1 pass above
# missed -- both ORDINARY JS/TS idioms, not obfuscation, confirmed against
# axios/"net" to isolate the resolver from the pre-existing lexical layer):
#
#   1. COMPUTED/BRACKET MEMBER ACCESS: `require('axios')['get'](url)` and
#      `const ax = require('axios'); ax['get'](url)` evaded round 1 --
#      `_resolve_ts_expr`/`_collect_ts_candidates` only ever inspected
#      `identifier`/`member_expression` nodes, never `subscript_expression`.
#      Fixed: `_resolve_ts_subscript` resolves `obj['fn']` the same as
#      `obj.fn` whenever the subscript is STATICALLY resolvable -- a
#      string literal, or (round 3) a NO-INTERPOLATION TEMPLATE LITERAL
#      (`` ax[`get`](url) `` -- template literals are an everyday idiom
#      many lint configs PREFER over quotes, not an obfuscation trick, and
#      `` `get` `` carries identical static text to `'get'`). A genuinely
#      COMPUTED subscript -- a non-literal key OR an INTERPOLATED template
#      literal (`ax[dynamicKey](url)`, `` ax[`${dynamicKey}`](url) ``) --
#      still resolves to `None`: the property name is a runtime value this
#      static resolver cannot evaluate. This is an intentional, tested,
#      documented gap (`test_computed_subscript_not_detected`,
#      `test_interpolated_template_subscript_not_detected`), not a silent
#      one -- filed as follow-up T-draft-e7c8b53c (dynamic-key resolution
#      is a fundamentally different problem: it needs either taint-style
#      "any string-keyed access on a dangerous object is worth flagging"
#      heuristics, or giving up precision entirely for that one case).
#   2. DYNAMIC `import()`: `import('axios').then(ax => ax.get(url))` and
#      `const ax = await import('axios'); ax.get(url)` evaded round 1 --
#      `_ts_import_table`'s walk only ever dispatched on `import_statement`/
#      `variable_declarator`, never an `import(...)` CALL expression (the
#      dynamic form is syntactically a call, not a statement). Fixed:
#      `_bind_ts_dynamic_import_then` binds a `.then(cb)` callback's first
#      parameter to the imported module; `_ts_module_call_target` (shared
#      with the `require()` path via `_unwrap_ts_await`) resolves an
#      `await`-ed dynamic import assignment the same way `require()`
#      already was. Both are STANDARD ways to consume a dynamic import
#      (the standard way to conditionally load a module in TS/JS at all,
#      and a natural place to hide a dangerous one) -- both now resolve
#      identically to a namespace `import * as`.
#
# T-0432 (computed/non-literal bracket-subscript resolution, light
# dataflow): a COMPUTED subscript that is a bare identifier or a single-
# substitution template literal (`ax[key](url)`, `` ax[`${key}`](url) ``)
# now resolves when `key` is bound to exactly ONE string literal anywhere
# in the file (`_ts_local_string_bindings`/`_ts_bound_subscript_text`) --
# closes the trivial `const key = 'exec'; ax[key](url)` indirection the
# T-0377 audit flagged as accepted-but-checkable. Deliberately NOT real
# reaching-definitions dataflow: a name reassigned to two DIFFERENT
# literal values anywhere in the file (including a plain `key = 'x'`
# reassignment, not just a second declarator) is excluded from the table
# entirely (stays unresolved, never guesses which value is live at the
# subscript site); a name assigned a non-literal value (a function call, a
# concatenation, a member-access key) is excluded the same way; a template
# literal with MORE than one substitution or any surrounding literal text
# still resolves to `None`. Considered and REJECTED: a fail-open heuristic
# ("any bracket access on an object resolved to a known-dangerous import
# is worth flagging regardless of subscript shape") -- the false-positive
# cost against ordinary dynamic-dispatch idioms (a lookup table, a plugin
# registry) was judged too high without a concrete finding to weigh it
# against; the light single-literal-binding dataflow above is the
# genuinely-closed subset, everything else stays an honest, tested
# limitation (`test_non_literal_bound_subscript_not_detected`,
# `test_multi_substitution_template_subscript_not_detected`,
# `test_reassigned_const_string_subscript_not_detected`).
#
# Known limitations, documented rather than silently eaten (mirrors this
# module's "Honest limits" posture): `export {x as y}` / re-export forms
# add no binding (not import sites -- a cross-FILE resolution, and this
# resolver, like the whole capability scanner, works one file at a time; no
# `export ... from`/`export * from`/`export default` cross-module linking is
# attempted, matching the taxonomy's own "needs source-module enumerability"
# caveat for the `export * from` row); a function-scoped `const`/`require`
# is folded into the same file-wide binding table as a module-level one when
# it is a plain `require()` destructure (a narrow, safe-direction over-
# approximation, same as Python's function-scoped `import`); a COMPUTED
# bracket subscript -- a NON-LITERAL key OR an INTERPOLATED template literal
# (a static, no-interpolation template literal DOES resolve, round 3 above)
# -- resolves only through the T-0432 single-literal-binding case above,
# else stays unresolved (T-draft-e7c8b53c tracks the fully-general case, see
# above); a `.then(cb)` callback's module binding is added to the FILE-WIDE
# table rather than scoped to the callback body (the same over-
# approximation as every other binding here -- can only ADD a resolution,
# never suppress a real one). A `class` FIELD holding a bound reference
# (taxonomy "class field/method holding a bound reference" row, `class C {
# run = cp.exec; }`) is NOT resolved through a later `new C().run(x)` call
# site -- that needs points-to tracking through CONSTRUCTED instances, a
# strictly harder problem than the by-local-name object-identity best effort
# `_ts_attr_rebind_lookup` gives ordinary object rebinding (T-0660); a
# `macro`-free language has no analog to Rust's `macro_rules!` row, so no
# gap exists here for it.
#
# T-0660: closes the previously-documented "no scope-local alias copy-
# propagation" gap (the T-0337 Python enhancement's TS/JS sibling) --
# `_build_ts_alias_table`/`_record_ts_alias`/`_record_ts_declarator_alias`/
# `_record_ts_default_param_aliases` now chase a local reassignment
# (`f = cp.exec`), a chained assignment (`a = b = cp.exec`), an array-
# destructuring bind (`const [f] = [cp.exec]`), default-parameter
# forwarding (`function f(cb = cp.exec)`), and a by-name member-target
# rebind (`obj.run = cp.exec`) the same way the python resolver's alias
# table does.
# C-C++/Kotlin remain OUT of scope for this pass; Rust gets its own binding-
# aware pass, T-0378 below.
