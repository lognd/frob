Transcription: pinned to the 2023 MITRE CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software
Weaknesses (cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html), noted
in-code and in threat.md with the staleness-review obligation. 25 ids
total: 8 reused from the existing CWE_CATALOG (CWE-79/89/78/22/918/502/
352/798, no duplication), 1 genuinely new WeaknessEntry (CWE-94, reusing
CWE-78's `exec` capability_kind join per the CWE-639/CWE-89 precedent --
mitigation "code_execution_sandboxing", distinct from CWE-78's
"argument_confinement"), 16 OutOfScopeEntry rows grouped by missing kernel
concept: memory-safety (CWE-787/416/125/119/476/190 -- no pointer/buffer/
allocator/arithmetic-width model), concurrency (CWE-362 -- no
synchronization/scheduling model), authn/authz-boundary (CWE-862/863/306/
287/269/276 -- no endpoint/route + authn/authz predicate concept, same gap
SEC-ROUTE-AUTHZ-001 already names), file-upload (CWE-434 -- no
content-type-validation sink), generic-precondition (CWE-20 -- no
structural precondition of its own, same class as CWE-840), and one
duplicate-coverage disclosure (CWE-77, generic parent of CWE-78's
already-cataloged OS-command instance -- same non-duplication discipline
as the stored-XSS note).

No genuinely new capability_kind was introduced (CWE-94 reuses the
existing "exec" kind); two fired-obligation test cases exercise CWE-94's
independent join anyway (test_cwe_94_fires_and_discharges_on_exec_capability,
test_cwe_94_fires_and_is_undischarged_with_no_claim), proving it fires and
discharges/refuses independently of CWE-78 sharing the same capability.

ASVS/cwe-1000 decision: kept unstubbed, rationale recorded in
docs/strata/threat.md#the-catalog-stdcwe -- ASVS is a verification
checklist standard (its items are process/testing requirements, not
discrete weakness ids with a natural precondition/mitigation shape;
transcribing would mostly duplicate CWEs already cataloged or add
capability_kind=None citation stubs with no new exhaustiveness signal).
cwe-1000 is MITRE's ~900-entry research view, the overwhelming majority
outside anything the closure engine's precondition vocabulary can express
-- transcribing it wholesale would produce hundreds of near-identical
OutOfScopeEntry rows citing the same handful of missing kernel concepts
already named above, burying genuinely actionable gaps rather than
surfacing them.

Design note: cwe-top-25's view table (CWE_TOP_25_VIEWS) is deliberately
NOT merged into the main VIEWS dict -- frob.strata._audit's
DEFAULT_SECURITY_VIEWS iterates every VIEWS key against the bare
CWE_CATALOG default, so merging would have silently under-catalogued
cwe-top-25 there (this was caught by test_audit.py/test_litmus_audit_
hardened.py regressions during verification and fixed by following the
QUALITY_CATALOG/QUALITY_VIEWS split's exact precedent).

Evidence: 11 test node ids recorded via `frob ticket evidence T-0143`
(tests/unit/strata/test_threat.py::TestCweTop25::*), all frob:tests-bound
to check_catalog_completeness / check_discharge_completeness / the new
catalog symbols.

Filed: none (no out-of-scope work discovered).

Gates: `uv run frob check` clean -- 86 violation(s)/55 waived vs the
86/54 pre-change baseline. Reviewer isolated the +1 waived instance
precisely: it is a PERF003 waiver at tests/unit/strata/test_threat.py:245
("two set comprehensions over small fixtures, not a join") inside the new
test_cwe_94_reuses_the_exec_capability_join method -- the same waiver
class already applied three times to identical next()-lookup shapes in
this test file, so an accepted pattern, not a new suppression. COV001/
COV002 satisfied via frob:doc + frob:ticket T-0143 directives on all new
public symbols and test methods. `uv run pytest tests/unit/strata/ -q`:
full suite green (all tests, including the audit/litmus regression this
work initially broke and then fixed). `frob test --base main`: touched-set
selection green (exit=0).
