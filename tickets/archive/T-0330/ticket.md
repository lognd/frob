Encode what a senior software designer knows (SOLID, ArjanCodes, Logan-Smith type-driven design, logging, fallibility) as STATIC checks over parsed source -- each with a concrete, non-hacky static proxy (subjective principles get objective detectable smells). CATALOG (each becomes a child ticket, ARCH1xx family):
SRP/cohesion: LCOM4 low-cohesion class (methods partition into disjoint field-usage components); god-module (unrelated exports); mixed-concern function (I/O capability + pure compute + formatting in one body).
OCP: type-dispatch smell (N+ isinstance/type==/tag switch on one variable -> polymorphism); non-exhaustive enum match.
LSP (Liskov): override raises NotImplementedError; override signature incompatible (narrower params / different-or-wider return = variance violation); override strengthens a precondition (adds assert/raise base lacks) or weakens a postcondition; override no-ops a value-returning base method.
ISP: fat interface (ABC/Protocol/trait whose implementers stub most methods with raise NotImplementedError/pass); client using only a subset of a wide injected interface.
DIP: LAYERING CONTRACT -- a declared allowed-module-dependency graph (import-linter style), violation = a high layer importing a low/concrete module across the boundary; concrete-collaborator construction inside a method instead of injection (no DI).
Type-driven (Logan Smith): make-illegal-states-unrepresentable (bool flag + validation -> enum/newtype); primitive obsession (many raw str/int params for a domain concept); parse-dont-validate (validates then returns the same unrefined type); boolean/flag parameter (public fn bool param switching behavior -> split).
Logging (CLAUDE.md 'log everything worth logging'): unlogged error path (except/raise/return-Err with no log in it); unlogged boundary (public entry / subprocess / net / fs site with no surrounding log); print()-as-diagnostics.
Fallibility (typani Result / Rust must_use): unhandled Result (Result-returning call as a bare statement, value discarded); swallowed exception (bare except / except Exception: pass); raises a recoverable error where the signature returns T not Result[T,E]; over-broad except; re-raise losing context.
Other smells: mutable default argument; feature envy (method uses another object more than self); data clumps (same 3+ params passed together repeatedly); magic numbers/strings in logic; module dependency CYCLES; dead private code (unreferenced private symbol); deep inheritance (DIT); temporal coupling (_initialized-flag guard).
Every check names its static proxy, severity, and the ARCHxxx id; each is waivable via the ARCH001-style reasoned override (T-0289). MUST coincide with strata (see the systems epic): logging-IN-CODE is arch; observability-OF-FLOW is strata -- no overlap.

ADVERSARIAL HARDENING (2026-07-20, see docs/design/structural-linter-adversarial-hardening.md): each ARCH1xx check must ground on the RESOLVED graph not a surface/syntactic proxy (measure the LOGICAL unit -- inline single-caller private helpers via the T-0288 call graph before complexity; a helper module called only by one class IS that class); resolve re-exports transitively and FAIL CLOSED on dynamic/reflective indirection; the generated marker (T-0234) must not exempt arch. Escape hatches are BOUNDED: waiver budget/density + reason-quality + staleness meta-gate, and global threshold loosening is an AUDITED config event, never silent (per-function reasoned override only, T-0289). Coincident with the conformance-totality epic T-0341.

EXHAUSTIVENESS DRIFT-LOCK (T-0343, 2026-07-20 mandate 'implementation MUST address EVERYTHING the exhaustive researcher found'): this epic's implementation binds to the corpus DENOMINATOR MANIFEST via T-0343's N:M coverage meta-test. Denominator source: architecture-check-catalog.md (tier-1 statically-checkable entries) + design-pattern-traps-corpus.md (trap hallmarks). Every relevant manifest entry must map to >=1 registered check/obligation/recommender-rule OR carry an explicit reasoned deferral (advisory/not-checkable/ticketed); (addressed union deferred) == TOTAL. The epic CANNOT close while any researched entry is un-addressed and un-deferred -- the corpora (docs/design/*) are the enforceable denominator, not just reading.
