Found while working T-1392 (verifying the full unscoped suite after fixing its 5 target failures). 'uv run pytest -q -p no:randomly -n 4 --tb=no -rf' surfaced exactly one FAILED: tests/test_ticket_land.py::TestLedgerV2LandMergeStory::test_disjoint_v2_tickets_land_with_no_custom_merge. Re-run standalone ('uv run pytest -q -p no:randomly -o addopts="" tests/test_ticket_land.py::TestLedgerV2LandMergeStory::test_disjoint_v2_tickets_land_with_no_custom_merge') passes in 0.45s. Not one of T-1392's five named deterministic failures and not touched by T-1392's diff -- looks like xdist worker contention over shared ledger/tickets.md state, not a genuine regression. Diagnose and either fix the isolation gap or mark the test appropriately; do not silently ignore -- a suite that flakes under -n 4 blocks confident 'make coverage'/CI runs the same way T-1392's deterministic failures did.
