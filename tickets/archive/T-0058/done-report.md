## Done report

Delivered tests/unit/strata/test_litmus_payments.py: the payments litmus
as kernel facts with naive and hardened variants. Golden findings all
fire with exact witnesses: (1) third-party response endorsement gap
(stripe -> f_stripe_resp -> api -> f_api_ledger -> ledger), (2) refund
decision on a stale replica (330.0s > 60.0s with the full read path),
(3) at-least-once webhook into a non-idempotent consumer (build
diagnostic). Positive controls: endorsed browser ingress PROVED(forall),
audit Reach PROVED(exists) with witness, assume ledgered with owner and
review. Notably the checker caught MY first hardened variant: endorsing
the response path alone still left stripe -> webhookq -> api -> ledger
open, so the remedy set gained b_webhook (signature verification) and
queue dedup -- the tool refuting its own author's incomplete fix is the
phase-0 exit criterion working as intended. Also fixed a ty typing gap
in the fixture and filed T-0089 (scaffold DX flake seen during the full
suite, unrelated to strata). Ticket check exit 0; 45 strata tests green.
