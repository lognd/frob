Re-measured 2026-07-23 by T-0597: the frob-dup check stage (frob check --only dup, the legacy find_duplicates scanner T-0597 was scoped against) currently shows 240 total groups, 110 already covered by full-group frob:waive DUP001/DUP002 directives, 130 unaccounted. Of the 130 unaccounted, 105 involve ONLY tests/** files (no src/frob/** member) -- a sibling ticket (see parent T-0597's Done/fail report) carves out the remaining 25 groups that touch src/frob/** for real extraction judgment; this ticket is the tests-only batch, which the T-0597 dispatch playbook expects to be mostly (not necessarily all) legitimate parallel-scaffolding false pairs.

Do NOT hand-copy a stale list: at the start of this ticket, run:

  uv run frob check --only dup --json

and filter diagnostics with severity=="warning" whose message contains no "src/frob" path segment -- that is the authoritative, current group list (it will have drifted again since this filing; T-0597's own dispatch saw the raw dup group count move 75->240 in about one day of concurrent landings). For each group: waive with an honest, specific, full-group frob:waive DUP001 (or DUP002) reason (T-0375's full-coverage rule -- every fragment's symref must be covered, no any-shared-symref shortcuts) if it is a coincidental structural/parallel-test-scaffolding pair, or extract into a shared test helper/fixture (with before/after test runs) if the shared logic is genuinely one thing duplicated, not parallel-but-distinct test intent. Given the volume, batch the work (e.g. by source test file or by group-size band) and commit incrementally per playbook section 12/discipline. Acceptance: frob check --only dup summary shows 0 unaccounted groups whose fragments are entirely under tests/**, no threshold loosened.
