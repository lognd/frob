    review by hand", never silently skipped and never guessed at'

Design: docs/design/refactor-verb.md (T-1135), "Prose-rewrite scope"
section. Filed per coordinator review of the design phase: T-1199
(directive/waiver carrier) covers only structured `frob:*` comment-DSL
directive targets; epic acceptance [2] also requires rewriting free text
that merely NAMES a moved symbol, which no filed child owned until now.

Extends T-1197's plan/apply pipeline with the three prose-rewrite items:

- Docstrings and comments naming the moved dotted path, anywhere in the
  repo, not just on the moved symbol's own code (e.g. "see
  `frob.gates._waive._match_waiver` for..." written in some unrelated
  module's docstring).
- `docs/**` prose and embedded code references: prose sentences naming
  the old module/symbol, and fenced code blocks citing the old import
  path.
- Doc anchor slugs whose heading text embeds the symbol/module name
  (a heading literally titled with a module name changes its own slug
  on rename) -- verified against `frob.gates._doclink_docanchor`'s
  `doclink_gate`/`docanchor_gate` (DOC001/DOC002) as the post-condition
  proof that no anchor broke.

Per the epic's acceptance [2], an unresolvable prose mention (ambiguous
natural-language mention, a name that is also a common English word, a
mention inside a generated/vendored file) must be listed explicitly in
the disclosed report as "not rewritten -- review by hand", never
silently skipped and never silently rewritten on a guess.

This ticket owns ONLY the free-text prose/doc-anchor rows; it does not
touch `frob:*` DSL directive targets (T-1199's scope) or the Python
import/call-site rewrite (T-1197's scope).

## Failure log
- 2026-07-29 attempt 1: duplicate creation (same command re-run while diagnosing scope-closure warnings); superseded by T-1267

## Drop reason
- 2026-07-29: duplicate: same frob ticket new invocation was run twice while diagnosing docs/** scope-closure warnings; superseded by T-1267 (identical content)
