Expands T-0177 into a long-lived per-project daemon that holds warm, incrementally-maintained state (obligation graph + per-symbol digests, test collection, coverage, dup analysis, gate results) and serves it to all clients (agents, make, MCP, CI) via single-flight execution + a content-addressed result cache. Root cause it solves (observed live over a long multi-agent session): N parallel agents each redundantly recompute the same expensive state (make core, make coverage ~5min each, frob check 114s stages, ticket sweep dup-scan ~90s) in isolated worktrees with no sharing, and background-then-stall on make coverage. Children: (a) warm graph + FS-watch incremental invalidation by digest; (b) single-flight coverage/collection keyed by source digest, shared across worktrees with identical content; (c) local unix-socket JSON-RPC query protocol; (d) frob CLI auto-proxies to the daemon if running, else in-process (make targets become thin shims); (e) subscribe/push events (coverage-fresh, graph-changed) -- the stall-killer; (f) resource leases/semaphores (coverage=1 writer). MCP becomes one frontend over the same core. See the design discussion 2026-07-19.


## Integration / replacement map (2026-07-19 -- surveyed all subcommands + queue)
The daemon is a warm SUBSTRATE under most read/analysis subcommands, not a new silo.

SUBCOMMANDS -> daemon relationship:
- Warm GRAPH QUERIES (served instantly from the warm graph, zero recompute):
  outline, map, xref, parse, graph, exports, bind, docs, stats -- become thin daemon reads.
- Warm ANALYSIS (incremental, single-flight, cached by digest): dup, arch, perf, vet.
- Warm GATE eval (touched-set, the expensive path): check, sys, test, ticket(sweep/doable/evidence).
- FRONTENDS over one core: `serve` (MCP) becomes ONE frontend; the unix-socket JSON-RPC API is
  another; the `frob` CLI proxies to the daemon if running (make targets stay thin shims).
- One-shot / orthogonal (stay plain CLI; may read from daemon): scaffold, cycle, release, mutate,
  gitlog, ack, deploy.

EXISTING TICKETS the daemon SUBSUMES or de-risks (fold in as children/deps of this epic):
- T-0177 (incremental gate eval over warm graph) -- the SEED; this epic generalizes it. SUPERSEDES.
- T-0245 (stat storms + sqlite contention on /mnt/c, 13-60x tax) -- warm in-memory state + a single
  sqlite owner eliminate the re-stat/contention entirely. SUBSUMED (or its standalone fix becomes the
  daemon's storage layer).
- T-0243 (cache.db not invalidated across frob/parser upgrades) -- daemon owns cache lifecycle
  (digest + tool-version keyed). INTEGRATED.
- T-0279 (frob:tests direction disagrees: fresh dsl parse vs stale graph cache) -- daemon keeps the
  graph always-fresh, so the entire stale-cache class disappears. INTEGRATED.
- T-0180 (vetted-library cache engine) -- daemon holds the vet cache warm. INTEGRATED.
- T-0242 (frob test -> native sys audit on touched .strata) -- daemon touched-set orchestration. CHILD.
- T-0322 (coverage --wait / single-flight) + T-0324 (parametrized evidence) -- steps toward the daemon;
  0322 is the stall-killer extractable first. T-0292/T-0298 (evidence/collection resolution) become
  trivial once collection is warm. RELATED.
- T-0178 (agentic time profiling) -- the daemon is the natural instrumentation point. RELATED.
- T-0325 (doc-drift digest graph) -- the daemon's HEADLINE query (what code/docs must update when X
  changes); only practical warm. CHILD.
- T-0323 (git merge driver for tickets.md) -- INDEPENDENT of the daemon; do first regardless.


## Client-interface design constraints (HARD requirements: no init/deinit, impossible to misuse)
The daemon is a TRANSPARENT ACCELERATOR, never a thing the user/agent manages. Non-negotiable:

1. NO lifecycle commands in the happy path. There is NO `frob daemon start` / `stop` / `init` a
   client must run first. You just run `frob <cmd>` (or `make check`, or an MCP call) and it works.
   (A `frob daemon status`/`stop` MAY exist for debugging, but nothing REQUIRES them.)
2. TRANSPARENT AUTOSTART: the first query that could benefit spawns the daemon if none is running,
   via an atomic single-instance guard (flock/socket-bind on a .frob/ lockfile) so racing clients
   resolve to exactly one daemon -- never an "already running" error, never two daemons.
3. AUTO-SHUTDOWN on idle (N min) and on project-dir removal. No orphaned processes; nothing to clean
   up. Killing the daemon at any moment loses NOTHING (all durable state is content-addressed on disk).
4. CORRECTNESS MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE DAEMON (the #1 safety invariant): a daemon-served result MUST
   equal the in-process result, always -- the daemon only makes it FASTER. Enforce with single-flight
   + digest-keyed cache + FS-watch invalidation, and a property/differential test that daemon-answer
   == cold-answer for every query type. A stale-cache-served-as-fresh is the cardinal failure -- attack
   it in review (races, watch-miss, clock skew) like a security bug.
5. TRANSPARENT FALLBACK: if the daemon is unreachable / crashed / a STALE frob VERSION (post-upgrade)
   / times out, the client SILENTLY falls back to in-process computation (and best-effort restarts a
   fresh daemon). The client NEVER hangs and NEVER surfaces a daemon error for a normal command.
6. SELF-HEALING VERSION SKEW: on a frob/parser upgrade the client detects the running daemon's version
   mismatch and the daemon self-replaces (ties to T-0243/T-0279) -- no manual restart, no stale cache.
7. ZERO required config; opt-OUT only (e.g. FROB_NO_DAEMON=1 forces in-process). Works on a fresh clone
   with no setup step -- this is exactly the 'no awkward setup step' the frob owner wants everywhere.

Acceptance: a fresh clone runs `frob check` with the daemon auto-managed end-to-end, no init/deinit
command ever issued; kill -9 the daemon mid-use -> next command transparently succeeds (respawn or
in-process); daemon-answer == cold-answer differential test green for every served query; FROB_NO_DAEMON=1
fully bypasses it with identical results.
