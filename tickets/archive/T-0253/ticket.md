T-0156 closing-review finding, now reproducible on main: is_self_pattern_path (T-0201) resolves the RUNNING package's module file paths, so the exclusion only matches when the scanned tree IS the running package (editable install). Under the uv-tool global binary, scanning frob's own checkout self-matches all pattern-catalog needle literals again: frob sys audit = 36 SYS100 false gaps; uv run frob sys audit = 0. Only affects auditing frob's own repo with a non-editable binary (sibling repos have no pattern files), but that is exactly what CI or a user would do. Fix: match by repo-relative path suffix of the KNOWN pattern files (src/frob/vet/_capability.py, _capability_registry.py, strata/_cve_fingerprint.py) against the SCANNED tree, not identity of the running package's files; keep the T-0201 drift-lock and extend it with a test that simulates a foreign-install scan (copy the tree to a tmp path, scan with the exclusion, assert zero self-matches).

T-4718 sweep (condensed from src/frob/vet/_capability_scan.py:100-143,
trimmed for DOCARCH002's 12-line cap): the trimmed block's full original
text, kept verbatim below.

# T-0253: `_SELF_PATH`/`_REGISTRY_PATH`/`_FINGERPRINT_CATALOG_PATH` above are
# identity anchors for THIS running package's own files -- correct only when
# the scanned tree and the running package are the SAME checkout (editable
# install: `uv run frob ...`). Under a non-editable global install (`uv tool
# install frob`), the running package's files resolve to a `site-packages`
# copy, so identity comparison against a SCANNED tree that is frob's own
# repo checkout never matches and every pattern-catalog needle self-matches
# again (36 false SYS100s under `frob sys audit` vs. 0 under `uv run frob
# sys audit`).
#
# Round 1 fix (REJECTED on review): matching by bare PATH SUFFIX (the last
# three path components: package dir / subpackage / filename) with no
# further check. That closed the false-positive but opened a real hole:
# `is_self_pattern_path` is reached from `_scan_directory_capabilities`/
# `_scan_directory_fingerprints`, the SAME public entrypoints `frob vet` uses
# to scan a VENDORED/THIRD-PARTY dependency tree. A malicious dependency
# that places a file at a path ending in `frob/vet/_capability.py` (trivial:
# nest it under any vendor path, or name the package `frob` outright) would
# be silently excluded from capability scanning by suffix alone --
# `is_self_pattern_path` cannot tell "we are auditing frob's own checkout"
# from "we are vetting someone else's tree that happens to mimic frob's
# layout" using the scanned PATH alone.
#
# Round 2 fix (this one): the suffix match stays as the within-frob file
# check, but it is only REACHABLE when a separate SCAN-TARGET discriminator,
# `_is_frob_repo_root`, says the tree actually being scanned is frob's own
# repository -- not the running package's install location (round 1's
# mistake), not the scanned FILE's path alone (round 1 REJECT's mistake),
# but the scanned tree's ROOT identity: `root/pyproject.toml` declares
# `name = "frob"` AND the root also has the `frob-core`/`strata-core` Rust
# crate directories this monorepo actually ships. Requiring both the name
# and the crate directories raises the forgery bar well past "name a PyPI
# package frob" -- a typosquat sdist would also need to vendor two dummy
# top-level directories with those exact names purely to fool this check,
# and gains nothing from doing so since `frob vet`'s dependency scan target
# is the DEPENDENCY's own extracted source root, not frob's repo root,
# in every real invocation. Self-conformance (`_selfconform.py`/
# `_effects.py`) always passes frob's own repo root as `root` by
# construction (self-conformance audits ITS OWN tree), so the discriminator
# is a no-op there; `frob vet` scanning a dependency passes that
# dependency's own source root, which is never frob's repo, so the
# discriminator (correctly) refuses the exclusion and the file gets scanned
# like any other.

T-4718 sweep (condensed from src/frob/vet/_capability_scan.py:681-730,
trimmed for DOCARCH002's 12-line cap): the trimmed block's full original
text, kept verbatim below.

# True for this module's own source file, the T-0158 registry it compiles
# `_PATTERNS` from, or the T-0153 fingerprint catalog it matches
# `_scan_file_fingerprints` against (excluded from directory aggregation
# since all three contain every needle as literal data, guaranteeing a
# self-match unrelated to what the code does). Public (T-0201): the
# SINGLE shared self-match exclusion -- vet's own directory aggregation
# below AND every `frob.strata._selfconform`/`_effects` join path must
# call this same function rather than keep parallel private copies, or a
# future pattern-catalog file re-introduces the T-0151 self-match class
# in whichever join path forgot to exclude it. This was T-0201's root
# cause: `_selfconform.py`'s extended-kind/all-kind scans and
# `_effects.py`'s line-effect scan all predated this export and had no
# exclusion of their own.
#
# T-0253 round 1 (REJECTED): matched by `_SELF_PATTERN_SUFFIXES` (package-
# relative path suffix) alone, with no scan-target check. That closed the
# non-editable-install false positive but opened a real evasion hole: a
# malicious dependency placing a file at a path ending in
# `frob/vet/_capability.py` would be silently excluded from `frob vet`'s
# capability scan too, since suffix matching cannot distinguish "this is
# frob auditing itself" from "this is frob vetting someone else's tree
# that happens to mimic frob's layout."
#
# T-0253 round 2 (this version): `root` is now the caller's scan-target
# discriminator -- the suffix match only fires when `_is_frob_repo_root
# (root)` says `root` IS frob's own repository checkout (its own
# `pyproject.toml` name plus its `frob-core`/`strata-core` crate
# directories), never based on `path` alone and never based on where the
# RUNNING package's own files happen to live (round 0's bug, identity
# comparison against `_SELF_PATH` et al., which broke under a non-
# editable global install). `root` defaults to `None`, which ALWAYS
# fails the discriminator (fail-closed, deny-by-default, matching this
# codebase's charter posture elsewhere) -- a caller that omits `root`
# gets "never exclude, always scan" rather than a crash, so this stays
# source-compatible with any caller written against the pre-T-0253
# one-argument signature while still closing the evasion hole for every
# real caller in this repo (all of which pass `root` explicitly).
# Self-conformance callers (`_selfconform.py`/`_effects.py`) always pass
# frob's own repo root by construction, so this is a no-op there; `frob
# vet` scanning a dependency passes that dependency's own source root,
# which is never frob's repo, so the exclusion correctly never fires and
# the file is scanned like any other.
