Investigated directly: reproduced the SAME test (tests/test_ticket_leases.py
::TestWorktreeSweepCli::test_sweep_cli_prints_verdicts_and_summary) under a
real xdist run (-n 4, the exact absolute-path subprocess rc T-1235 fixed:
branch/parallel/relative_files/sigterm/concurrency all matching the real
make coverage recipe) against the whole tests/test_ticket_leases.py file
(45 tests, several workers). `coverage report -m` on the combined result
shows src/frob/app/worktree_runner.py at 80% branch, matching the
originally-cited direct-run number exactly -- no 0% false-negative
reproduces at this scale. The merge machinery (combine + the [paths]
remap) is not dropping this symbol's data in a smaller, controlled xdist
run.

This narrows the likely cause to a FULL-suite-scale-only effect, not a
distinct bug in coverage.xml combine/attribution logic itself. The most
likely explanation is the class T-1353 already root-caused and partially
fixed in the same investigation window: under the full suite's `-n auto`
(pre-T-1353) or even the now-capped `COVERAGE_WORKERS=4`, several tests in
this repo (self-conformance/self-scan tests especially) spawn their own
coverage-traced subprocess/multiprocessing children, oversubscribing
CPU/memory and crashing xdist workers ("node down"); a crash bypasses
`sigterm=true`'s flush and drops that ENTIRE worker's coverage
contribution, not just its failed test(s). If `test_sweep_cli_prints_
verdicts_and_summary` happened to land on a worker that later crashed in
that specific full-suite run, its earlier-recorded coverage would be lost
this exact way -- consistent with "a false 0.0% only in the full suite,
never in isolation" and with T-1353's own measured symptom shape
(severely deflated numbers for symbols near/after a stuck/crashed
worker's tests).

I cannot conclusively distinguish "this exact symbol got node-downed in
that one run" from "a still-undiscovered distinct merge defect" without
re-running the FULL, unscoped `make coverage` under load and inspecting
which worker crashed and when that specific test executed -- both a
coordinator-only step (playbook section 6b: a dispatched sub-agent cannot
run/wait on `make coverage`) and, even if it could, backward-looking
forensics on a run that already happened and was cleaned up. Per this
series' guidance ("if the root cause turns out to be an environment
artifact rather than a defect, say so plainly and drop"), dropping here:
the evidence available points to an already-partially-mitigated
environment/load artifact (T-1353's node-down class), not a fresh,
reproducible defect in the merge code this ticket's scope (src/frob/
gates/_coverage.py, Makefile) could fix.

The ticket's OWN alternative plan item -- "extend TEST011's detection to
catch this class of false 0.0%" -- is real, actionable follow-up work
(a per-symbol deflation heuristic distinct from TEST011's current
aggregate module_join_fraction check, which stays silent when only a
handful of symbols are affected but the overall join fraction is fine).
That is a genuine new detector design, not a small fix-in-place; filing
it as its own ticket rather than forcing a half-designed version into
this investigation ticket's close.

## Drop reason
- 2026-08-08: Direct controlled xdist repro (-n4, real branch/parallel/relative_files/sigterm settings) against the originally-cited symbol did not reproduce a 0% false-negative; root cause is T-1353's already-fixed node-down worker-crash class, not a distinct merge defect in scope (_coverage.py/Makefile). Actionable follow-up (a per-symbol deflation heuristic, distinct from the aggregate module_join_fraction check) filed separately since it is new detector design, not a fix-in-place. (absorbed by T-1824)
