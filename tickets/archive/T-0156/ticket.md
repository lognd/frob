Get frob into a releasable state once the gates-zero sweep and the three feature tickets land. Deliverables: (1) version bump decision (current 0.1.0 line -- pick the next version honestly against the scale of what shipped) stamped via frob release stamp, with frob release check green as the gate; (2) CHANGELOG.md generated from the ticket archive + git history since the last release, grouped by area (strata, threat/CVE, vet, check/gates, tickets, editors), human-readable, every T-#### referenced; (3) README refresh: current subcommand table, strata overview with the self-model/self-conformance story, editors support, CVE mirror workflow, install paths (uv tool install, bare pip, dev) each verified by actually running them; (4) docs/index.md completeness pass -- every docs/ page linked, every public module documented; (5) packaging: uv build the wheel, decide and document the native-crate strategy (strata-core/frob_core: bundled, separate wheels, or optional with the T-0133-135 degrade contract -- verify the degrade contract works from the actual built wheel in a bare venv, and verify the T-0142/T-0152 dependency completeness holds there too); (6) final release gate: frob check exit 0 with gates at zero, frob sys audit fully PROVED, full pytest suite green, drift-locks all live. Do not tag or publish -- leave the repo in a provably releasable state and report what the release command sequence would be.
