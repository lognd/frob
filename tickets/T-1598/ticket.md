Produce the evidence base for the expansion, so the language set is defensible rather than a guess.

Deliverables:

1. A ranked target list of 20-50 languages, each row citing its sources. Use several independent rankings and say where they disagree: TIOBE, RedMonk, GitHub Octoverse, Stack Overflow Developer Survey, and IEEE Spectrum are the usual five; weight by what a frob user is plausibly running in a repo that needs obligation tracking, not by raw popularity alone (COBOL and MATLAB rank higher than their relevance here; CUDA and Zig rank lower than theirs).

2. Per language: tree-sitter grammar availability and maturity (this repo already depends on tree-sitter-language-pack -- record which targets it already ships, which need a separate crate, and which have no usable grammar at all, since that last group changes the cost dramatically).

3. Per language: comment syntax for the directive DSL, including the awkward cases -- languages with no line comment, languages where the block comment cannot nest, and languages with significant indentation that constrains where a directive may sit.

4. Per language: what "public symbol" even means. This is where the abstraction will strain. Header/implementation splits in C/C++, Java package-private, Rust pub(crate), Go capitalization, C# internal, and shell functions with no visibility concept at all do not share one definition. The research must state the intended per-language rule BEFORE any adapter is written.

5. A recommended batch order, with the user's five named languages (C#, Java, CUDA, Zig, Bash) first.

Output goes in docs/ as a durable reference, not just a ticket comment -- later batches read it.
