## Description

T-1491 (final cutover) deliberately did NOT delete the v1 splice
machinery (`_render_ledger`, `splice_ledger` in
`src/frob/tickets/_land_ledger_merge.py`, `_land_merge.py`,
`_land_merge_zones.py`, the `tickets.md`/`tickets-archive.md`
`.gitattributes` merge-driver lines) because this repo's OWN ledger is
still v1-mode as of T-1491's session -- every ticket mutation across a
multi-agent dispatch still depends on `splice_ledger` via the registered
git merge driver. Deleting the machinery before this repo's own
`tickets.md`/`tickets-archive.md` content is actually migrated to v2
(via `frob ticket migrate` once the v1-to-v2 migrator is CLI-wired --
see T-1492) would break every in-flight worktree's ticket operations
immediately.

## Plan

Blocked on: T-1492 (CLI wiring for `frob ticket migrate --to v2`), the
follow-up default-flip ticket (T-1553, renumbers at land), and
a coordinator-chosen quiet window (per this ticket's own stated
precondition) to actually run the migration against this repo's real
`tickets.md`/`tickets-archive.md`.

1. Coordinator runs `frob ticket migrate --to v2` against this repo in a
   quiet window (zero in-flight worktrees).
2. Observe the LEDGERV1001 deprecation window for the recorded interval.
3. Delete `_render_ledger`, `splice_ledger`, `_land_merge.py`,
   `_land_merge_zones.py`, remove the `.gitattributes` merge-driver
   lines, remove `tickets.md`/`tickets-archive.md` from the repo (or
   archive them as historical artifacts per the coordinator's call).

## Acceptance

- [ ] GIVEN this repo's own ledger has been migrated to v2 in a quiet
      window WHEN this ticket lands THEN `_render_ledger`, `splice_ledger`,
      `_land_merge.py`, `_land_merge_zones.py`, and the `.gitattributes`
      merge-driver lines no longer exist, and `frob check` reports zero
      references to any of them.
