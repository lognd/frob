Every frob log record appears TWICE in pytest output, in two different formats:

    WARNING: gitio: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD failed (rc=128): fatal: not a git repository...
    WARNING  frob.gitio:gitio.py:232 gitio: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD failed (rc=128): fatal: not a git repository...

Cause: frob configures its own root logging via dictConfig with lazy stdout/stderr StreamHandlers (src/frob/logging/handler.py, logger.py). Under pytest, that handler writes into the captured stream AND pytest's own logging-capture plugin reports the same record from the log-capture buffer. Both reach the report.

Why it is worth fixing rather than tolerating: it doubles the volume of every test log, and it makes occurrence COUNTING unreliable -- grepping a log for how many times a condition fired silently returns twice the real number. During this drive, counts pulled from test logs had to be sanity-checked by hand more than once for exactly this reason. A log you cannot count is a log you cannot measure with.

Fix direction: do not install frob's own stream handlers when running under pytest (pytest's capture is already reporting them), or set propagation so exactly one path reports. Whichever is chosen, assert it: a test that emits one record and asserts it appears exactly once in the captured output.

Also verify, and state the answer in the Done report, whether ordinary CLI invocations double as well. A probe during triage did not produce a warning at all, so the CLI case is UNVERIFIED rather than known-clean -- do not assume it is fine because the pytest path explains the observed instances.
