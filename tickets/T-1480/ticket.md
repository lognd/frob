docs/commands/sys.md documents frob sys as having five verbs today
(plan/doc/export/audit/sync-interface) and names check/trace/capacity/
threats as later phase-5 verbs not yet landed on main. No ticket
currently tracks building these four verbs. Found while draining
NEGEXIST001 (T-1477): the doc's absence-claim had no
frob:until binding.
