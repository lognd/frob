frob can express "this ticket is blocked by that ticket" but cannot express "this ticket must be the last thing done in the repository". The distinction matters for audit-shaped work whose correctness depends on everything else being finished.

Concrete case: the waiver cop-out audit. Its blocked_by edges can only name tickets that existed when it was filed. Any ticket filed afterwards must ALSO precede it, but nothing in the graph says so, and nothing stops an agent from popping it early. Today the constraint survives only as prose in the body, which is exactly the kind of tribal knowledge frob exists to replace with enforcement.

Proposed: a runs-last marker (a tier value, a flag, or a blocked_by_all sentinel) that makes such a ticket structurally undoable while ANY other non-terminal ticket exists.

Requirements:
- `frob ticket doable` must never return a runs-last ticket while any other queued/in-progress ticket exists, regardless of filing order.
- `frob ticket start` on one must refuse with a message naming what remains.
- More than one runs-last ticket must be allowed (they order among themselves by ordinary blocked_by edges).
- Filing a NEW ordinary ticket while a runs-last ticket is in-progress should warn loudly: the precondition it started under has been invalidated.

That last requirement is the one that makes this real rather than cosmetic -- the failure mode is not starting the audit too early, it is finishing it and then having new work land that silently invalidates its conclusions.
