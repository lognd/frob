TIER005: sprint stays a pure filter -- refuse at write time a parent that names a sprint label (belt) and add a lint-only check flagging any that slipped in historically (suspenders). A sprint cannot close anything and cannot be closed. Lands at WARN.

Positive control: a ticket with parent pointing at a sprint label is refused at write time; TIER005 flags a historical one; zero findings on a clean ledger stays quiet.
