Child of T-2375 (LARGE001 burn-down epic). Measured 2026-08-21 via 'frob check --json --budget 500' (severity=warning, code=LARGE001) -- do NOT trust this ticket's own file list without re-measuring first; the tree moves. Each file listed here exceeds frob.toml's max_file_lines=800 threshold.

Per-file disposition is a JUDGMENT CALL, not a mechanical split: T-1651 already established that several LARGE001 files in this repo (_models.py, _waive.py, _land_git_ops.py, check_runner.py, config.py, sys_runner.py -- NOT in this batch, already resolved via frob:waive) are cohesive single-concern files where a line-count split would cut a real seam apart and be STRICTLY WORSE than the warning. For each file in this batch: either (a) find a genuine consumer-set/responsibility seam and split it, or (b) if no real seam exists, add a 'frob:waive LARGE001 reason="..."' with the same rigor T-1651's own waivers show (naming why no split is a real seam, not just 'it is big'). Both are valid closure for a given file; a forced split with no real boundary is not.

Do NOT touch src/frob/strata/_selfconform.py -- it is T-2729's own ticket (largest LARGE001 offender, 2290 lines), already filed, do not absorb it here.

Closure for this CHILD ticket: every file below reads as severity=note (waived) or disappears from LARGE001 entirely when re-measured. Do NOT flip LARGE001 warning->error severity here -- that promotion is T-2375's own final step, deferred until every sibling batch lands (promoting early reds main for siblings' still-open debt).
