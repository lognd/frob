Phase 3 of T-1339, depends on both the detector and the Tier-A handler. Drive the existing population to zero via frob check --fix: 37 'type: ignore' lines exist, 20 already dual-dialect, 17 mypy-only, 6 ty-only. Expect far fewer than 23 actual findings, since evidence-driven detection only fires where the other checker genuinely reports -- the remaining unpaired lines are legitimately fine and MUST NOT be touched. Add a lock test so a regression reds main.

WITHDRAWN by T-1339's DESIGN AMENDMENT (2026-07-31): the successor question originally posed here -- whether to migrate the 17 legacy mypy-only ignores to ty and drop the mypy dialect from this repo -- is answered NO and must not be pursued. The goal is portability: those mypy suppressions are load-bearing for downstream consumers who type-check frob with mypy, even though mypy never gates here. Do not delete or migrate a suppression for a checker this repo does not run.

Expect this ticket's real work to GROW rather than shrink under the amendment: with mypy installed as an oracle, the ty->mypy direction now produces findings too, so lines carrying only a ty suppression will need mypy pairs added.
