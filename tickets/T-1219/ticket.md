Umbrella epic: migrate the Python-side tree-sitter tree-extraction layer (frob.lang._extract.extract, _walk_python, _common.walk) into frob_core (PyO3/Rust), per the report's Rust-migration-candidates ranking. This is the largest single native-cost family measured (perf 38 pct, clones 69 pct, deprecated 76 pct, dead_symbols 88 pct, opaque 92 pct, sys ~50 pct -- summed ~40-50s native per full check) and is not covered by frob_core today (existing kernels consume the token lists this layer produces). 4 children: tree-extraction kernel, capability-scan resolver, arch metrics single-pass walk export, and an interim zero-Rust tree-sitter Query step for comment/docstring spans. New FFI boundaries must satisfy FFI001/FFI002 (src/frob/gates/_ffi_boundary.py).
