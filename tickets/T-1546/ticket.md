Follow-up from T-1537 (frob ticket evidence --replace): that ticket shipped the CLI primitive (replace_evidence) but not the detection half its own body named -- frob refactor rename (or an equivalent rename-detection pass) should notice when a renamed/parametrized symbol/test node id is bound as a ticket's evidence and offer (or auto-apply) the matching --replace rebind, closing the loop the T-1520 parametrization incident exposed by hand.
