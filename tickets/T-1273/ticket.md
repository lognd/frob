TEST005 attribution is now honest (T-1235: subprocess + pool-worker
coverage recorded) and floors are recalibrated to unit_branch_cov=75 /
module_line_cov=70 (frob.toml [testing], rationale in-file). Inventory on
this baseline: 1335 TEST005 findings (943 symbol/branch-coverage, 391
module/line-coverage), of which 206 symbols sit at exactly 0.0% branch
coverage -- the priority tier, since a 0.0% symbol is either dead code
(never called from a live path -> route to DEAD-gate/dup scrutiny or a
removal ticket, not a fake test) or a genuinely untested entry point.

This epic parents one child ticket per top-level package with findings,
ordered by 0%-symbol count descending, plus one child for the floor
ratchet-up schedule once a package clears zero. Children carry the
package's finding count, its 0.0% symbol list (or a representative
sample + full count for large buckets), scope limited to that package's
src+tests paths, and GIVEN/WHEN/THEN acceptance requiring the package's
TEST005 count to reach zero at current floors via real behavioral tests
-- never assert-True filler -- with dead symbols routed away from testing
entirely.
