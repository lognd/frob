scope_breadth_ack_reason: 'WAVE14-B (T-draft-57d64be9): this is a genuine epic/umbrella
  ticket

  tracking a whole multi-child campaign, not a single unit of work with a

  precise file list -- its scope is deliberately broad because its own

  children (each individually precisely scoped) are what actually touch

  files. Acknowledged rather than narrowed per the TICK009 epic-tier

  exemption this drive built.

acceptance:
- text: 'GIVEN frob refactor move/rename/split on a symbol or module family WHEN it
    completes THEN all imports and call sites are rewritten (absolute imports, auto-aliasing
    on destination or import-site name conflicts, with a disclosed alias report),
    and every frob-owned reference moves with the symbol: frob:tests/frob:doc/frob:enforces
    target forms, waiver symrefs including path:: prefixes, PII012 (file,token) allowlist
    entries, check-coverage registry citations, and archived-ticket evidence node
    ids'
  evidence: []
- text: GIVEN a refactor that cannot complete every rewrite THEN it refuses and rolls
    back rather than leaving a half-move; post-conditions verified in-command (import
    graph resolves, tests collect, gate findings diff-clean vs pre-refactor)
  evidence: []
- text: 'GIVEN a moved or renamed symbol WHEN the refactor completes THEN every mention
    of it in prose is rewritten too: docstrings and comments naming the dotted path
    (including all frob: comment-DSL directive targets anywhere in the repo, not just
    those attached to the moved symbol), docs/** prose and code refs, and doc anchors
    whose heading slugs embed the symbol or module name -- auto-documentation updating
    is part of the transaction, with unresolvable prose mentions listed in the disclosed
    report rather than silently skipped'

User directive 2026-07-28: refactors today mean an agent hand-editing every import and callsite, and -- the expensive part -- hand-carrying frob's symbol-attached bookkeeping. Second user directive same day: the rewrite must ALSO cover frob symbols and symbols in comments -- auto-documentation updating -- because a rename that fixes code but strands docs/docstring/comment mentions just converts silent breakage into doc drift (the DRIFT001/DOC006 class this repo keeps paying down). Evidence from this drive: 3 coordinator INV006 waiver carries in one wave (0abc4e3a), PII012 allowlist re-keying on every move (T-1076), the ARCH101/103 waiver-symref path:: bug where moved waivers never matched again, archived evidence repoints after litmus renames (8dae48c5), DRIFT002 edge repoints. frob owns the graph/binding/exports substrate to do this transactionally. Python first; the multi-language binding tables (TS/Rust/C-C++/Kotlin) extend it later. Children to file at design time: reference-rewrite engine, directive/waiver carrier (absorbs T-1134), registry/evidence repointer, split verb built on the T-1072/T-1077 family-extraction pattern, alias-conflict policy. Relationship: makes T-1108/T-1115-class split tickets mechanical.
