The T-1323 mass-invalidation guard refuses to delete when >= 5 waivers of one rule go stale in one run. Correct for degraded runs -- but it also means a rule whose waivers become GENUINELY mass-stale (detector tightened, mass refactor) is permanently uncleanable: every run re-flags them, the auto-fix always refuses, warnings never drain. The guard cannot currently tell 'detector died' from 'detector ran and they really are all stale'.

Refinement: when the SAME self-manufactured run produced >= 1 live finding of the target rule elsewhere in the tree, the detector demonstrably ran and can find that rule -- mass-staleness is then trustworthy, and deletion may proceed (still capped per run, still one rule at a time, still logged per waiver). When the rule has ZERO findings anywhere (the degraded signature, exactly what T-1578's structural signal also targets), keep refusing as today. Depends on T-1578 conceptually but is independently implementable; blocked_by is intentionally not set.

## Done report

`_mass_invalidation_rule` (singular, first-match-wins) refused the
ENTIRE WAIVE004 auto-fix batch whenever any one rule's stale-waiver
count in a self-manufactured run met `_WAIVE004_MASS_INVALIDATION_
THRESHOLD` (5) -- correct for a degraded run (the 2026-07-29 incident
this guard was built for), but it also meant a rule whose waivers
become GENUINELY mass-stale (a detector tightened, a mass refactor
removed the pattern several waivers covered) could never be cleaned by
this handler again: every run re-flags the same waivers, every run
refuses, warnings never drain.

Implemented the refinement exactly as scoped: `_mass_invalidation_
rules` (plural) now returns every rule meeting the threshold, and each
is judged independently by the new `_rule_has_live_finding` -- if the
SAME self-manufactured run's `report.violations` also contains at
least one REAL (non-WAIVE004) finding of that rule elsewhere in the
tree, the detector demonstrably ran and can still find it, so
mass-staleness is trustworthy and that rule's candidates proceed to
deletion (still one rule's own candidates at a time, still logged per
waiver, still capped by the same threshold per rule). A mass-stale
rule with ZERO live findings anywhere keeps refusing exactly as
before -- unchanged from the pre-T-1579 behavior for the genuinely
degraded case, and unchanged for every rule that never hits the
mass-invalidation threshold in the first place.

`docs/modules/gates.md`'s WAIVE004 incident writeup gained a
"Refinement (T-1579)" paragraph describing the same self-heal logic.
`docs/design/check-fix-engine.md` was in scope but needed no edit --
its "no threshold loosening" anti-goal section describes a different
mechanism (baseline/ratchet comparison) this change does not touch.

Residual, disclosed rather than forced (same shape as T-1577's Done
report): a `--ticket T-1579`-scoped `frob check` sees SCOPE001/SCOPE002
<!-- frob:waive DOC006 reason="historical Done report: docs/modules/gates_e501_autofix.md was real when this landed; T-1580's own follow-up (also in this ledger) later folded it into gates.md and deleted it" -->
noise against 3 files T-1581 touched in this same worktree
(`docs/modules/gates_e501_autofix.md`, `src/frob/gates/_fmt_
directives.py`, `tests/test_gates_fix_engine.py`) because T-1581's own
code commit (90d65fc2) did not include "T-1581" in its subject line --
T-0108's cross-ticket SCOPE001 exemption keys off a `T-\d{4}` reference
in the attributing commit's subject, and that commit predates this
observation (fixing it now would mean amending an already-referenced,
already-Done-reported commit, which the git safety protocol forbids
without an explicit user request). `_fix_engine.py` itself is exempt
from this since T-1579's own declared scope covers it directly.
`frob check --land-parity` -- the actual land-sweep-equivalent check --
reports CLEAN (0 unscoped errors) against the current combined
worktree tree, confirming this is per-ticket-scoped-check noise from
multi-ticket-worktree sequencing, not a real land blocker.

Separately, while verifying T-1579's own gates, found and fixed one
more instance of the SAME ambiguous-scope-coverage gap T-1577's own
edit to `_waive.py` exposed (`_WAIVE004_STRUCTURALLY_UNVERIFIABLE_
RULES` ambiguously covered by 3 open tickets' scopes at once,
T-1577/T-1342/T-1339) -- resolved with an explicit `frob:ticket T-1577`
directive, committed under T-1577's own scope (`_waive.py` is not in
T-1579's declared scope) as a small follow-up commit
(f90842a5), not folded into this ticket's own changes.
