A frob directive that is too long today gets a trailing "# noqa: E501" and stays on one line forever. There are 3016 such directive lines in src/ and tests/ right now. They should instead be WRAPPED into the canonical backslash-continued form, and the noqa removed.

Current behavior, and why this is not already wired:

- frob fmt / the FMT001 Tier-A handler (fix_fmt001_directive_wrap, T-1261/T-1391) already knows how to canonicalize a frob directive run into wrapped, within-limit form. The wrapping machinery exists and works.
- But T-0985 made a directive run ending in a "# noqa" / "# noqa: CODE" pragma pass through VERBATIM (_NOQA_SUFFIX_RE in src/frob/gates/_fmt_directives.py, the _rebuild-runs half of canonicalize_text). The noqa is treated as a deliberate escape hatch for an unwrappable single token.
- Nothing anywhere strips a noqa. So the pragma is a one-way ratchet: once added, that line is permanently exempt from wrapping, whether or not it was ever genuinely unwrappable.

The T-0985 escape hatch is correct for its real case -- a directive whose logical text is ONE unbreakable token longer than the limit (a very long parametrized test node id with no space to break at) cannot be helped by wrapping, and would otherwise be reformatted pointlessly on every run. The bug is that the hatch is applied by PRESENCE OF THE PRAGMA rather than by actual unwrappability.

Proposed rule, which preserves T-0985's intent while fixing the ratchet:

1. For a frob directive run ending in a noqa pragma, attempt the canonical wrap with the pragma removed.
2. If every resulting physical line fits within the limit, keep that wrap and DROP the noqa -- it was never needed.
3. If any line still exceeds the limit (the genuine single-unbreakable-token case), restore the pragma and pass through verbatim exactly as today.

That makes the pragma self-retiring: it survives only where it is load-bearing, and it can never again be added to a line that wrapping could have fixed.

Deliverables:
- The rule above implemented in _fmt_directives, so both frob fmt and the FMT001 Tier-A handler inherit it.
- A one-time sweep applying it across the repo, expected to remove the large majority of the 3016 pragmas (a rough scan says 3005 have wrappable logical text, though the real number is whatever step 2 actually validates -- measure, do not assume).
- Tests covering all three branches: wrappable-with-noqa loses the noqa; genuinely-unwrappable keeps it byte-identically (extending the existing T-0985 byte-identical tests rather than replacing them); no-noqa behavior unchanged.
- Because the sweep touches thousands of lines across many files, land it as its own commit separate from any behavioral change, so review and bisect stay tractable.

Caution learned this drive: this handler rewrites source files unattended on the land path. FMT001 is already scoped to the touched set at land time (T-1404) precisely because an unscoped rewrite reintroduced out-of-scope edits. Keep that scoping; the one-time repo-wide sweep should be a deliberate, reviewed operation, not something a land quietly performs.
