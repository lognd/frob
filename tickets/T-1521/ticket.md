Disclosed cut from T-1196: check_cross_file_references only covers the two
reference shapes elaborate() itself does not already validate at all
(flow src/dst). Whether flow src/dst validation belongs inside elaborate()
itself (so a single-file design also gets it too) is left as a design
question for this follow-up.
