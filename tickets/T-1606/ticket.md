frob wraps directive comments against ONE project-wide line-length limit, read from [tool.ruff] line-length in pyproject.toml (read_line_length, src/frob/gates/_fmt_directives.py). For Python that is exactly right: ruff owns the limit, ruff is what a "# noqa: E501" silences, and frob correctly steals the value rather than keeping a competing one.

For every other language it is wrong. Each language's own formatter owns its width, and frob currently wraps Rust, C, C++, TypeScript, and everything else against Python's ruff-derived number:

- Rust: rustfmt.toml / .rustfmt.toml -> max_width (default 100)
- TypeScript/JavaScript: .prettierrc (any of its several forms) or a package.json prettier key -> printWidth (default 80)
- C/C++/CUDA/Java/C#/ObjC: .clang-format -> ColumnLimit
- Go: gofmt has no width limit at all -- the correct behavior is "do not wrap on width"
- Zig: zig fmt likewise has no configurable width
- Bash: no standard formatter; shfmt has no width option

Note the last three: "this language has no width limit" is a distinct, legitimate answer, not a missing config to default. Wrapping a directive in a language whose formatter would never complain is pure churn, and worse, it would keep reformatting on every run.

This was disclosed as a known limitation in T-0441's Done report and left as a follow-up. The language expansion epic promotes it from cosmetic to blocking: adding 20-50 languages against a single Python-derived width is exactly the kind of Python-shaped assumption in shared code that the epic exists to surface.

Deliverables:
- Per-language limit resolution: for a given file, find the limit its OWN toolchain would enforce, from that toolchain's own config file, with that tool's documented default as the fallback.
- A first-class "no width limit" answer for languages whose formatters do not have one, and directive wrapping skipped entirely for those files.
- The resolution is a lookup keyed by language, so a new adapter declares its width source once (fits the adapter capability matrix the contract ticket defines -- do it there rather than as a side table).
- Config discovery walks upward from the file, not just the repo root: a monorepo can have a different .prettierrc per package, and the nearest one wins, matching how the real tools resolve.
- Tests per language: config present, config absent (tool default), and no-limit languages.

Do not change the Python path's behavior: ruff stays the owner there, and the existing ruff-derived value must keep coming out unchanged.
