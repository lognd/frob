T-1433's SIGUSR1 stack-dump handler (tests/conftest.py::_install_stackdump_handler/_dump_all_thread_stacks) is currently wired ONLY into the pytest test-session lifecycle (pytest_configure), gated behind FROB_COVERAGE_STACKDUMP. WIRE001 flags both helpers as unreached outside their own tests, since tests/conftest.py itself is a test-path the gate's text scan skips. Follow-up: evaluate whether frob's own daemon/CLI processes (frob serve, frob check's own subprocess pool) would benefit from the same opt-in handler for non-coverage-recipe wedges, or whether the current pytest-only scope is intentionally final (in which case this ticket should close as won't-fix with that recorded).
