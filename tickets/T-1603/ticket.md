Add Zig to frob's supported languages, meeting the full adapter contract defined by the contract ticket -- not merely parsing.

Language-specific considerations to resolve explicitly: pub as the explicit visibility marker, comptime blocks, error unions in signatures, and doc comments (triple-slash) distinct from ordinary comments. Zig has no macro preprocessor, which makes it a cleaner symbol-extraction target than C/C++ -- a good early probe of whether the contract is genuinely language-agnostic.

Required for done:
- Symbol extraction producing stable node ids across reparses.
- Directive DSL parsing in this language's comment syntax, including wrapped/continued directives.
- Participation in the obligation graph: doc edges, test edges, and waivers behave as they do for Python.
- The parameterized adapter conformance suite passes with no skips, and any capability declared unsupported is declared explicitly rather than silently absent.
- A fixture repo (or fixture files) exercising the awkward cases named above.

If shared code needs a special case to accommodate this language, STOP and file that as a separate finding against the shared layer. A special case is evidence the abstraction is wrong, and absorbing it quietly is how the shared layer becomes Python-shaped by accretion.
