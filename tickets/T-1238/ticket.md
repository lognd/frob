  ticket

  tracking a whole multi-child campaign, not a single unit of work with a

  precise file list -- its scope is deliberately broad because its own

  children (each individually precisely scoped) are what actually touch

  files. Acknowledged rather than narrowed per the TICK009 epic-tier

  exemption this drive built.

User directive 2026-07-29: frob is intimidating; group everything together. First concrete slice: the T-0580-deprecated navigation commands (map/outline/xref/docs-search) regroup into frob explore instead of being deleted -- this SUPERSEDES the 2026-10-01 sunset (T-0802 dropped with this epic as the reason). Design phase first for the full taxonomy (candidate buckets to evaluate, not prescribe: explore/navigation, quality/check+test+fix, tickets, design/sys+strata, supply-chain/vet, ops/release+registry+natives+doctor+clean, serve/perf tooling); un-deprecation of the explore members includes removing the docs 'Kept commands'/deprecation drift the 2026-07-29 staleness sweep catalogued. Children to file at design time: taxonomy design doc, explore group implementation, alias/transition machinery, help-surface rework, docs/index updates.
