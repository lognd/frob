The deferred post-land unscoped sweep (T-1684) for T-2374 at commit 7b2ee6567148f6e79b856cd5e83785b8ba82711a found 2 new (rule, file) identit(ies) that were not present in the previous sweep's baseline.

T-1935: this is a count of DISTINCT (rule, file) IDENTITIES (2), not a raw finding count -- every finding sharing a (rule, file) pair collapses into ONE identity here (deliberately, so attribution and quarantine reason about "which files went red", not individual diagnostics). An independent re-measurement found 2 actual finding(s) across those 2 identit(ies).

New (rule, file) identit(ies) filed here:

- COV004  tickets/T-2195/attachments/02-independently-confirmed-frob-cycle-vacuous-on-src-layout-widened-acceptance-criteria-and-fix-guidance-no-src-lexical-special-case.md

Attribution (T-1690, symbolic reachability over the verify queue's touched-symbol sets):

Under the rapid profile the sweep runs detached and files this ticket rather than reverting an already-published commit. Fix the errors, or -- if they are pre-existing residue the rolling baseline simply had not recorded yet -- close this ticket with that finding stated explicitly.
