T-1271's own declared scope (src/frob/_cli_parsers/__init__.py, src/frob/
app/config.py, docs/modules/app.md, tests/test_app_config.py) covers only
the AppConfig pydantic layer -- it cannot reach the actual argparse parser
builders (src/frob/_cli_parsers/_ticket/**, _check.py, etc.), the
scope-closure warning emitter, frob check's lease requirement, or ticket
renumber's own --help text, all of which several of T-1271's acceptance
criteria depend on. T-1271 implemented the minimal honest core that DOES
fit its scope (a generic AppConfig field_validator that gives every
ticket-model enum flag -- state/kind/kind_value/tier/tier_value/
priority_level/origin/review_verdict -- an inline valid-values error
message, replacing the bare TicketState(v)-shaped ValueError) and disclosed
the rest here rather than silently widening scope.

Remaining work from T-1271's acceptance criteria, for a properly-scoped
follow-up ticket (or several):

1. (AC0 remainder) Non-ticket-model enum-shaped CLI flags still raise
   whatever their own conversion path raises with no valid-values list --
   e.g. check_type ("python"/"cpp"/"rust"/"typescript", a plain string
   field with no argparse choices=), any argparse choices= flag whose
   error text isn't already argparse's own (which DOES list choices).
   Audit src/frob/_cli_parsers/**/*.py for every type=/dest= flag lacking
   argparse choices= or an AppConfig-level validator and either add
   choices= or a validator per the T-1271 precedent.

2. (AC1) Repeated advisory warnings (scope-closure on `ticket new` observed
   flooding 5000+ lines in one invocation) need to collapse to a counted
   summary with a --verbose escape hatch. Likely lives in
   src/frob/tickets/_scope*.py or wherever scope-closure warnings are
   emitted, plus a new --verbose-style AppConfig field and _cli_parsers
   wiring -- outside T-1271's scope.

3. (AC2) `frob check --ticket` for a read-only invocation (review, show,
   brief) should never require or mutate a lease. Lives in
   src/frob/check/** (lease acquisition) -- outside T-1271's scope.

4. (AC3) A porcelain verb that sequences the ticket close happy path
   (start -> done-report -> evidence -> accepts -> close), plus
   documenting `ticket renumber`'s positional-only contract with --help
   examples. Lives in src/frob/tickets/** and _cli_parsers/_ticket/**  --
   outside T-1271's scope.

5. (AC4) A short cli-hygiene principles doc under docs/design/ (not
   docs/modules/app.md, which is T-1271's only in-scope doc target) plus a
   checklist test/gate rule verifying new parsers against it (every flag's
   help string states its default; no flag silently changes another
   flag's meaning). docs/design/ was not in T-1271's scope globs.

Filed by T-1271's Done report (2026-08-04) per the epic-closure
"minimal honest core, disclose the rest" instruction.
