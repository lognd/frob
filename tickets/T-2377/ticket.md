Measured via `uv run frob check --json --budget 500` (full gate-summary coverage,
no BUDGET001 deferral) piped through `scripts/check_summary.py`, 2026-08-18.

WARN-tier finding count, this family (exhaustiveness checks (unhandled enum/union arms)): 179 across codes EXHAUST002, EXHAUST003.

Do NOT hand-count with grep -- this repo has measured false zeros that way, including
one tonight. Re-measure with the same command above before starting and before
claiming done; treat any disagreement with the number in this body as the tree
having moved, not as your measurement being wrong.

Closure is two-part per the epic (T-0969):
1. Zero findings for every code above, verified via the same
   `frob check --json --budget 500 | python3 scripts/check_summary.py` command.
2. Each code above promoted from warning to error severity in its gate module
   (grep the gate module for its severity constant/mapping) -- a burn-down that
   stops at zero and leaves the gate advisory lets the debt silently reaccumulate.
   DOC012 and the T-1662 arc both closed correctly today by doing both; follow
   that shape, not a zero-only burn-down.

Narrow `scope` to the actual files this family's findings live in once you've
run the gate and can see them -- do not take a broad blanket scope; this keeps
you disjoint from sibling children of T-0969.
