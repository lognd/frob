User directive 2026-07-18: the pass-line counters hide real debt -- frob-exports reports 12-253 public symbols missing from __init__.py per package (decide policy: export or demote to private, per package, no blanket waiver), frob-dup 64 duplicate groups (triage: real extraction candidates vs false pairs; feeds T-0187 tree), frob-arch 197 warnings + 123 suggestions (long-function/god-class residue post-calibration -- fix or waive with reasons), perf gate 174 violations (166 waived -- re-audit every waiver still holds after T-0161's heuristic fixes land; the 8 unwaived need real fixes). Deliverable: each family driven to a state where the summary line is HONEST -- zero unwaived findings or a written per-finding reason; no threshold-loosening without a disclosed decision. Split into child tickets per family if any single family exceeds a session of work -- this ticket is the umbrella and the accounting.

User mandate 2026-07-19: a frob deploy utility built into strata. The threat model: red teams compromise the one user that owns a service and nothing isolates that user -- lateral and vertical movement must be PROVABLY blocked, not hoped. The deployment sequence (idempotent install, status/health, uninstall with NO artifacts) must be auditable end to end, including an expensive opt-in VM-snapshot audit (VirtualBox) that is NOT part of make check. Scripts must tie into the model so hand edits are DETECTABLE through the strata checker, and the 'weird layer between the OS and the backend' (users, groups, units, ownership, ports) becomes provable architecture. Children: std.host OS-layer modeling -> movement-impossibility proofs + deploy script generation -> script<->model conformance gate -> VM snapshot audit harness -> real-service pilot (malmberg) remediating its awkward setup. Umbrella closes when all children close.

T-0254 child 6 (proof on reality). Apply the full chain to malmberg (the real server product from pilot P3: server_api/ingest/cloudsync/faces/backup/display + media_store): extend design/malmberg.strata with std.host (dedicated service users per component, units, ownership of media_store paths, ports), prove HOST001/HOST002 movement-impossibility or record honest waivers, generate the deploy scripts, run the conformance gate, and if a VirtualBox environment is available run the full VM snapshot audit and attach the attestation. Remediate the current awkward setup step in malmberg's docs/scripts with the generated sequence. Work happens IN THE MALMBERG REPO per the break-and-report pilot protocol (frob-side gaps come back as tickets, filed serially by the coordinator); this frob-side ticket tracks the campaign and collects the gap list. Success = malmberg installs/uninstalls via generated scripts with a green conformance gate and a documented (or executed) VM audit path.

Expands T-0177 into a long-lived per-project daemon that holds warm, incrementally-maintained state (obligation graph + per-symbol digests, test collection, coverage, dup analysis, gate results) and serves it to all clients (agents, make, MCP, CI) via single-flight execution + a content-addressed result cache. Root cause it solves (observed live over a long multi-agent session): N parallel agents each redundantly recompute the same expensive state (make core, make coverage ~5min each, frob check 114s stages, ticket sweep dup-scan ~90s) in isolated worktrees with no sharing, and background-then-stall on make coverage. Children: (a) warm graph + FS-watch incremental invalidation by digest; (b) single-flight coverage/collection keyed by source digest, shared across worktrees with identical content; (c) local unix-socket JSON-RPC query protocol; (d) frob CLI auto-proxies to the daemon if running, else in-process (make targets become thin shims); (e) subscribe/push events (coverage-fresh, graph-changed) -- the stall-killer; (f) resource leases/semaphores (coverage=1 writer). MCP becomes one frontend over the same core. See the design discussion 2026-07-19.


## Integration / replacement map (2026-07-19 -- surveyed all subcommands + queue)
The daemon is a warm SUBSTRATE under most read/analysis subcommands, not a new silo.

SUBCOMMANDS -> daemon relationship:
- Warm GRAPH QUERIES (served instantly from the warm graph, zero recompute):
  outline, map, xref, parse, graph, exports, bind, docs, stats -- become thin daemon reads.
- Warm ANALYSIS (incremental, single-flight, cached by digest): dup, arch, perf, vet.
- Warm GATE eval (touched-set, the expensive path): check, sys, test, ticket(sweep/doable/evidence).
- FRONTENDS over one core: `serve` (MCP) becomes ONE frontend; the unix-socket JSON-RPC API is
  another; the `frob` CLI proxies to the daemon if running (make targets stay thin shims).
- One-shot / orthogonal (stay plain CLI; may read from daemon): scaffold, cycle, release, mutate,
  gitlog, ack, deploy.

EXISTING TICKETS the daemon SUBSUMES or de-risks (fold in as children/deps of this epic):
- T-0177 (incremental gate eval over warm graph) -- the SEED; this epic generalizes it. SUPERSEDES.
- T-0245 (stat storms + sqlite contention on /mnt/c, 13-60x tax) -- warm in-memory state + a single
  sqlite owner eliminate the re-stat/contention entirely. SUBSUMED (or its standalone fix becomes the
  daemon's storage layer).
- T-0243 (cache.db not invalidated across frob/parser upgrades) -- daemon owns cache lifecycle
  (digest + tool-version keyed). INTEGRATED.
- T-0279 (frob:tests direction disagrees: fresh dsl parse vs stale graph cache) -- daemon keeps the
  graph always-fresh, so the entire stale-cache class disappears. INTEGRATED.
- T-0180 (vetted-library cache engine) -- daemon holds the vet cache warm. INTEGRATED.
- T-0242 (frob test -> native sys audit on touched .strata) -- daemon touched-set orchestration. CHILD.
- T-0322 (coverage --wait / single-flight) + T-0324 (parametrized evidence) -- steps toward the daemon;
  0322 is the stall-killer extractable first. T-0292/T-0298 (evidence/collection resolution) become
  trivial once collection is warm. RELATED.
- T-0178 (agentic time profiling) -- the daemon is the natural instrumentation point. RELATED.
- T-0325 (doc-drift digest graph) -- the daemon's HEADLINE query (what code/docs must update when X
  changes); only practical warm. CHILD.
- T-0323 (git merge driver for tickets.md) -- INDEPENDENT of the daemon; do first regardless.


## Client-interface design constraints (HARD requirements: no init/deinit, impossible to misuse)
The daemon is a TRANSPARENT ACCELERATOR, never a thing the user/agent manages. Non-negotiable:

1. NO lifecycle commands in the happy path. There is NO `frob daemon start` / `stop` / `init` a
   client must run first. You just run `frob <cmd>` (or `make check`, or an MCP call) and it works.
   (A `frob daemon status`/`stop` MAY exist for debugging, but nothing REQUIRES them.)
2. TRANSPARENT AUTOSTART: the first query that could benefit spawns the daemon if none is running,
   via an atomic single-instance guard (flock/socket-bind on a .frob/ lockfile) so racing clients
   resolve to exactly one daemon -- never an "already running" error, never two daemons.
3. AUTO-SHUTDOWN on idle (N min) and on project-dir removal. No orphaned processes; nothing to clean
   up. Killing the daemon at any moment loses NOTHING (all durable state is content-addressed on disk).
4. CORRECTNESS MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE DAEMON (the #1 safety invariant): a daemon-served result MUST
   equal the in-process result, always -- the daemon only makes it FASTER. Enforce with single-flight
   + digest-keyed cache + FS-watch invalidation, and a property/differential test that daemon-answer
   == cold-answer for every query type. A stale-cache-served-as-fresh is the cardinal failure -- attack
   it in review (races, watch-miss, clock skew) like a security bug.
5. TRANSPARENT FALLBACK: if the daemon is unreachable / crashed / a STALE frob VERSION (post-upgrade)
   / times out, the client SILENTLY falls back to in-process computation (and best-effort restarts a
   fresh daemon). The client NEVER hangs and NEVER surfaces a daemon error for a normal command.
6. SELF-HEALING VERSION SKEW: on a frob/parser upgrade the client detects the running daemon's version
   mismatch and the daemon self-replaces (ties to T-0243/T-0279) -- no manual restart, no stale cache.
7. ZERO required config; opt-OUT only (e.g. FROB_NO_DAEMON=1 forces in-process). Works on a fresh clone
   with no setup step -- this is exactly the 'no awkward setup step' the frob owner wants everywhere.

Acceptance: a fresh clone runs `frob check` with the daemon auto-managed end-to-end, no init/deinit
command ever issued; kill -9 the daemon mid-use -> next command transparently succeeds (respawn or
in-process); daemon-answer == cold-answer differential test green for every served query; FROB_NO_DAEMON=1
fully bypasses it with identical results.

frob arch today has per-language walkers (_python.py, _cpp.py) only. To extend cleanly (not N copies of each check), introduce a NORMALIZED CODE MODEL: a language-agnostic view (module, class, function, method, param, branch, loop, call, import, override, field-access, return, raise/throw, catch) that each language adapter maps its tree-sitter grammar onto. Checks are written ONCE against the model; adapters supply per-grammar node-type maps. Then add adapters for TypeScript, Rust, Kotlin (Kotlin needs tree-sitter-kotlin added to frob.lang; ts/rust/cpp/c already parse via tree-sitter-language-pack). Language-specific checks (Rust must_use/ownership, TS any/strict-null) live in per-language extensions on top of the shared model. Acceptance: an arch check written once fires correctly across python+ts+rust+kotlin on equivalent code; Kotlin grammar wired; the existing python/cpp checks refactored onto the model with no regression. Children: normalized-model, ts-adapter, rust-adapter, kotlin-grammar+adapter.

User mandate (2026-07-20): 'ensure that you stop ALL methods EXHAUSTIVELY across ALL LANGUAGES of evading detection. ENSURE THAT IT IS 100% EXHAUSTIVE via LANGUAGE SPEC.' HONEST ARCHITECTURE (recorded so no one later mistakes the goal for the impossible one): a sound STATIC analyzer cannot resolve runtime dispatch (getattr/eval/reflection/dynamic-require/fn-ptr-from-data) -- Rice's theorem. So 'exhaustive' means: (1) EXHAUSTIVE-RESOLVE the DECIDABLE fragment -- enumerate FROM EACH LANGUAGE SPEC every static name-binding/aliasing/re-export/copy construct (imports, import-as, from-import[-as], star-import, local + chained + attribute rebinding, destructuring, tuple/list unpack, Rust use/use-as/pub use, C/C++ #define + using-decl + function-pointer init from a named fn + typedef'd fn-ptr, Kotlin import-as + ::ref + typealias) and resolve calls through all of them, transitively, per-scope, cycle-guarded, WITHOUT regressing shadowing soundness (a benign/param binding must stay silent); (2) FAIL CLOSED on the UNDECIDABLE fragment -- every spec-defined runtime-resolved indirection becomes an 'opaque capability indirection' obligation (fires, requires a reasoned waiver), consistent with strata's prove-or-reject philosophy (T-0290 recursion, arch-override). DELIVERY: (a) dispatch exhaustive-research to produce the per-language evasion denominator from the actual specs (the coverage denominator for acceptance 1) + the opaque-construct list (acceptance 2); (b) child tickets per language implementing the static resolver to its denominator + litmus; (c) one child for the fail-closed opaque-indirection obligation in the scanner/strata may-analysis; (d) a cross-language exhaustiveness meta-test binding each denominator entry to its litmus (fails if a construct has no fixture, like the CVE catalog drift-lock). T-0337 (Python local rebind) and T-0328 (Python import resolution) are the first two leaves. This is the 'you cannot get around it' guarantee the whole tool exists for.

The user asked (2026-07-20): 'what mechanisms enforce conformance to the .strata file? Do we force every module to declare its purpose and interface?' -- and to harden it adversarially. Design north-star: docs/design/structural-linter-adversarial-hardening.md. Today _code_binding.py (bind_code/ConformanceReport/check_import_conformance) and _effects.py::check_capability_conformance exist, and T-0331 already mandates 'NO obligation satisfied by bare declaration' -- but conformance is NOT TOTAL, which is the evasion surface: (1) un-modeled modules escape all obligations; (2) a node can declare a partial interface while the code exports more; (3) nothing binds a module's PURPOSE to an allowed-effect profile; (4) binding need not be total, so logic can be laundered into an unbound file. This epic closes those into the five acceptance criteria above (SYS-COV coverage totality, exact interface conformance, purpose contract, binding totality + effect conformance, bounded escape hatches + gated config), each a child ticket. Soundness rests entirely on the exhaustive binding-aware scanner (T-0328/T-0337/T-0339) -- this epic is the conformance layer ON TOP of that foundation. Coincident with the arch epic (T-0330) and strata-systems epic (T-0331); this is the 'the model cannot lie about the code' guarantee made total.

_scan_file_fingerprints (CVE matching) is lexical needle-matching for EVERY language including Python -- a renamed import defeats a fingerprint even where capability scanning is binding-aware.

Full-repo pessimistic capability audit (2026-07-20, 7 read-only auditors). North-Star: if frob check / a ticket-close / a strata proof passes, the thing it claims must ACTUALLY hold. The audit found the North-Star is violated in concrete ways across subsystems. Each subsystem audit gets an umbrella child holding its full findings table; each HIGH finding gets an actionable child. Findings files live in the audit run; this epic is the durable tracked home so the audit itself does not become an orphaned document (the exact failure mode that motivated it). Consolidation in progress as the 7 auditors land: tickets/testing (evidence integrity), strata (vacuous proofs), graph/edges, gates-accounting, gates-quality/security, vet (lexical resolution), lang/check/docs.

A capable-but-unbound module is a hard obligation failure -- this closes acceptance-criterion (1) 'un-modeled modules escape all obligations'. Depends on T-0630 wiring real code binding into production entrypoints so the check has real data to run against, not just unit-test fixtures.

A node's declared interface must equal the bound module's real public surface (no under- or over-declaration) -- closes acceptance-criterion (2). Depends on coverage-totality's binding pass existing first (need a bound node before its interface can be checked).

Closes acceptance-criterion (5): every conformance escape hatch (interface/purpose/binding waivers) must be bounded (expiry/staleness-gated) and surfaced in an un-droppable floor view so it cannot become a permanent silent exemption.

User mandate 2026-07-22: contention semantics are worthless unless ENFORCED -- a declared mode nothing verifies is the catalogued-is-not-enforced trap (T-0343 doctrine). For every node with code= bindings and a declared resource mode (T-0700 grammar), join the declaration against the code's OBSERVED effects (the T-0595 code-binding pattern, wired to production per T-0630; effect classification from the vet/T-0339 capability resolvers): READ = zero write-capable operations against the resource (write-mode opens, os.remove/rename, SQL DML, sends on the port) -- fail-closed on opaque access to the resource; APPEND = writes only via append-mode opens, no truncate/rewrite; ALPHA (update/upgradeable-lock intent, user-specified) = reads freely, but every observed WRITE against the resource must be provably preceded on the same path by an upgrade acquisition (alpha->write transition through the declared arbiter) -- a write reachable while still in alpha-only context fails closed; additionally the model-level alpha+alpha exclusion (at most one alpha declarant per resource) is checked at elaboration, and the code-level analysis flags the upgrade-deadlock ANTI-PATTERN (acquiring write while holding plain read on the same resource, the case alpha exists to prevent -- recommend alpha in the finding); WRITE = read+write allowed but only on declared paths (undeclared sibling access = finding); EXCLUSIVE = write conformance PLUS every observed access provably inside the declared arbiter/lease context (join T-0694's code-level lock identification with the model-level arbiter declaration; an access path outside the arbiter fails closed). Violations are SYS errors naming the node, the declared mode, and the offending observed operation. Litmus fixtures per mode, firing and clean.

T-0717 shipped the shared mode-qualified capability vocabulary
(frob.vet._capability_modes: FAMILY_MODES, CAPABILITY_MODE_KINDS,
LEGACY_CAPABILITY_ALIASES, resolve_capability_kind/expand_declared_kind/
canonical_declared_kind/normalize_observed_kind) and wired it live for the
fs family only (fs.read/fs.write, WIRED_MODE_FAMILIES={"fs"}) -- the one
family the acceptance tests exercised. net.connect/net.listen,
env.read/env.write, proc.spawn, and ffi.call are DEFINED in FAMILY_MODES
but deliberately NOT exploded by expand_declared_kind/normalize_observed_
kind yet (a bare may "net" stays exactly {"net"}), because the vet
scanner has no connect/listen (or env-read/write, proc, ffi-call)
distinction to normalize observations against -- exploding the
declaration side without a matching observation side would make every
existing bare "net"/"env"/etc. declaration spuriously SYS101-stale.

Follow-up work, explicitly not done in T-0717:
1. Extend frob.vet._capability's per-language needle tables with a real
   connect-vs-listen split for net (e.g. socket.connect vs socket.bind+
   listen; net.connect vs net.listen in TS/Rust equivalents), and an
   env read-vs-write split, before adding those families to
   WIRED_MODE_FAMILIES.
2. Mechanical sweep of this repo's own design/frob.strata declarations
   and DEFAULT_BENIGN_CAPABILITIES (src/frob/strata/_threat.py) once a
   family is wired, mirroring what T-0717 did for fs (BenignCapability
   entries + CAPABILITY_KINDS registration would be needed for fs.read/
   fs.write too if any node ever declares them precisely -- currently
   design/frob.strata only uses the still-legal coarse "fs"/"fs-read"
   spellings, so this was deferred).
3. ESTATE migration (mandate point 3): once net/env/proc/ffi are wired,
   file per-repo tickets (T-0573 fleet routing) for the 8 sibling repos'
   own capability declarations to adopt the precise family.mode spellings
   ahead of the T-0717 alias sunset (fs-write/fs-read, 2026-10-20).

Re-run frob check --only dup --json at the start of this ticket (do not trust this snapshot -- T-0597's own dispatch drifted 75->240 groups in one day). For each group: genuine extraction (shared logic into one home, update call sites, before/after tests, TEST016 mutant-kill check per the T-0597 dispatch playbook) or an honest full-group frob:waive DUP001/DUP002 reason if it is a false pair. Acceptance: frob check --only dup summary shows these 25 groups' fragments no longer among the unwaived (fixed-or-waived), frob-cycle stays clean, no import cycles introduced.

## Done report

TEST016 send-back: frob ticket land refused because the previously bound
evidence killed 0 of 3 mutants introduced on this ticket's changed-line
spans in src/frob/__main__.py and src/frob/app/config.py (both files
picked up context/merge churn from this ticket's dup extractions):

- src/frob/__main__.py:2556 -- exc_info=True negated to exc_info=False in
  main()'s top-level exception handler.
- src/frob/app/config.py:1033 -- the Path division building the
  pyproject.toml path in _declared_frob_version swapped to another binop.
- src/frob/app/config.py:1042 -- the project-name inequality guard in
  _declared_frob_version swapped from != to ==.

All three are killed by tests that already exist in the repo but were not
bound as T-0861 evidence:
tests/unit/test_main_entry.py::TestMainUnhandledException::test_unhandled_exception_logs_with_exc_info
asserts _log.error is called with exc_info=True (hand-verified: flipping
the literal to False makes the assertion fail).
tests/unit/test_config.py::test_stale_install_warning_flags_version_mismatch
exercises _declared_frob_version through stale_install_warning: the Div
mutant raises TypeError building the path (hand-verified), and the NotEq
mutant makes repo_version resolve to None so the expected warning never
fires, failing the "warning is not None" assertion (hand-verified).

Both are now bound as T-0861 evidence; no source change was needed since
the mutants were already dead, just previously unbound.

T-0204 child (waive family). gate:WAIVE reports 562 warnings at 2026-07-23 baseline, dominated by WAIVE004 "waiver matches 0 findings this run" from a FULL check (authoritative, unlike scoped-run WAIVE004 flakes -- see T-0846/T-0850 history). A waiver matching nothing in a full run is stale: the underlying finding was fixed or the rule changed. Sweep: for each WAIVE004 in a full run, delete the waiver; where deletion resurfaces a real finding, that finding is the honest state (fix or re-waive with a current reason). Also triage any WAIVE003-class aging warnings. MUST be run against a full (not scoped) check and re-verified with a second full run after the purge. Deliverable: gate:WAIVE 0 warnings.

Found while working T-0786 (gate-vacuousness sweep).

frob.lang's tree-sitter ingestion (`_parse` in src/frob/lang/__init__.py,
~line 316-370) reads the ENTIRE file into memory (`path.read_bytes()`) and
hands it to tree-sitter's `parser.parse(source)` with no file-size cap and
no parse timeout, for every file frob's graph walk visits -- including
files under an audited/untrusted repo tree (this is a general-purpose
static-analysis tool other people's repos get pointed at, not just this
one's own source). Tree-sitter's incremental-parse error recovery is
generally robust but is not immune to pathological-input classes (deeply
nested brackets/parens driving quadratic-ish recovery, or simply a
multi-GB single file) -- and there is no structural guard here at all, not
even a generous one: no `st_size` check before `read_bytes()`, no
wall-clock budget around `parser.parse()`.

Fix direction: add a configurable max-file-size guard (skip + record a
PARSE001-shaped "too large to parse" finding rather than attempt it) and a
wall-clock timeout around the tree-sitter parse call in `_parse`, so a
single adversarial or merely enormous file cannot hang or exhaust memory
in a `frob check` run over an untrusted tree.

Add a regression test (and, if practical, a static lint) asserting every

enforces a bounded size/time budget before/around the actual
tree-sitter/strata-core parse call -- so a future refactor cannot silently
drop the guard the paired fix ticket adds.

T-0715's user mandate asked for existing EPIC-titled tickets to get
`tier: epic` mechanically as part of the migration to the new
`TicketTier` field (landed by T-0715 itself). This ticket is the actual
one-time backfill: scan `tickets.md`/`tickets-archive.md` for tickets
whose title matches the repo's existing "EPIC" naming convention (case-
insensitively prefixed, e.g. titles starting "EPIC:" or "EPIC "), set
their `tier` field to `epic` via the normal `frob ticket` write path (not
a hand-edit), and record the count changed in the Done report. Also worth
deciding here (not decided by T-0715): whether direct children of an
epic-titled ticket should default to `tier: story` at the same time, or
whether that requires a human judgment call per ticket.

Acceptance: GIVEN the ledger as it stood at T-0715 land WHEN this
migration runs THEN every ticket whose title matched the EPIC convention
carries `tier: epic` afterward, and no other ticket's tier changed.

T-0715's user mandate also asked for velocity/burndown derived from
ledger state-transition history (closed-per-sprint counts), explicitly
"no new storage" -- i.e. it must be computed from the same
`frob:tests`/Done-report/state history already in the ledger and git log,
not a new tracked field. This is a real design + implementation gap on
its own: today's `Ticket`/ledger model does not retain a transition-
history log at all (only the CURRENT `state`), so "closed-per-sprint"
needs either (a) mining git log diffs of `tickets.md` for `state: done`
transitions per commit, correlated with each ticket's `sprint` field
(landed by T-0715), or (b) a lightweight append-only transition-log this
ticket would introduce (weighed against the "no new storage" mandate).
Depends on T-0715 (the `sprint` field) being in place first.

Acceptance: GIVEN a sprint with N tickets closed across several commits
WHEN `frob ticket sprint show <label>` (built by the CLI-surface child
ticket) is asked for velocity THEN it reports a closed-count derived
from history, not a hand-maintained counter, and the number matches a
manual `git log` tally of `state: done` transitions for that sprint's
tickets.

parents the burn-down children needed before each remaining family can be
safely promoted to ERROR without redding main.

Found while working T-0997 (coverage pipeline fix): a real, fresh `make
coverage` run in a clean worktree (merged to main tip) shows ~118 test
failures that are NOT caused by coverage instrumentation -- reproduced
several individually WITHOUT --cov and they still fail (e.g.
tests/test_registry_reconciliation_patterns.py::TestExhaustivenessGateOverRealPatterns::test_no_patterns_violations,
tests/test_ticket_land.py::TestLand::test_dry_run_lands_cleanly_and_leaves_no_trace,
tests/system/test_cli_check.py::TestGitlessTargetGateSeverity::test_render_lint_gate_warns_not_errors_on_gitless_root).
These span registry-reconciliation exhaustiveness self-checks
(patterns/compliance/secrets/supply_chain/weaknesses/system_design all
report real violations against this worktree's live tickets.md/registry
state), ticket-land/evidence-enforcement system tests, and a handful of
CLI system tests. Because pytest exits non-zero, `make coverage`'s
Makefile recipe halts before its own `coverage combine`/`coverage xml`/
`frob check --stamp-coverage` lines run, so a fresh `make coverage`
currently requires a manual combine/xml/stamp workaround to get any
numbers at all -- and the failing subprocess-heavy system tests never
contribute their coverage, capping how far `join_fraction` can rise
(0.49 observed vs T-0997's target of "well above 0.34"; a green suite
would likely push it meaningfully higher). Needs triage: some of these
may be genuine registry drift in this worktree's ticket state (dozens of
concurrent worktree agents landing tickets) rather than a real product
bug; others (the gitless-target severity assertion, the render-lint
stderr-vs-logging-capture mismatch) look like real, fixable test/gate
bugs. Scope was deliberately not widened to fix these under T-0997.

T-0992 added the land-side monotonicity backstop and it has now correctly REFUSED a third stale-bump attempt (T-0997 land computed 0.183.0 vs main 0.184.0). But the producer bug remains: _apply_release_bump_for_land derives its baseline from the worktree-carried release manifest/pyproject that rode the squash. Fix the callback to read the baseline from ROOT current state (same git-show technique as the guard) so the guard becomes a never-fires invariant instead of a per-land speed bump requiring a manual worktree merge. Churn-epic member: each guard refusal costs a merge+reland round trip.

`frob.graph.callgraph.scope_private_helper_gaps` (T-0998, SCOPE002
direction 5) narrows its `build_call_graph` candidate set to files sharing
a scoped file's PARENT DIRECTORY. For a flat top-level directory like
`tests/` (hundreds of files, one dir), this degrades to "every test file
in the whole tests/ tree" the moment any single test file is in scope --
observed live: scoping `tests/test_graph.py` alone produced 4000+ SCOPE002
"review the dependency" findings, almost all naming a same-named `_write`/
`_run` helper private to some unrelated sibling test file, not a real
under-capture signal.

WARN-only (never blocks), so this is noise, not a correctness bug -- but
noisy enough that a real agent would tune it out entirely rather than
read the real hits buried in it. Needs a narrower per-scope candidate-set
heuristic for large flat directories (e.g. cap candidate file count, or
require the SAME leaf-name collision to be genuinely ambiguous before
flagging, or scope the search to files matching the ticket's own SOURCE
directory conventions rather than a raw parent-dir match) before this
direction is trustworthy enough to read routinely. Filed instead of fixed
under T-0998's own scope/effort budget.

verified clean via frob.strata._access.resource_contention_violations
(SYS204). SYS203 itself (src/frob/strata/_contention.py::
check_resource_contention) remains permanently mode-blind by design: it
has no code path that reads Module.resources or a node's access= attrs at
all, so it keeps firing on tickets_ledger's five writers regardless of the
now-modeled arbiter, and the five SYS203:tickets_ledger waivers (cli/
gates/fleet/core/serve in design/frob.strata) stay in place, permanently
justified rather than pending re-evaluation.

This ticket is the actual code-level follow-up: teach SYS203 (or a new,
narrower successor rule) to consult a resource's declared arbiter
(arbitrated_by/lock) the same way SYS204 already does, so a store with a
provably-safe declared arbiter stops being flagged by SYS203 at all,

T-0698's own text names a fourth advisory shape ("sequential awaits over
independent IO -> suggest gather") this ticket's implementation did not
build: proving two `await` expressions are INDEPENDENT (neither reads a
value the other produced) needs a data-dependency analysis this repo's
current `frob.arch` normalized model does not yet provide (NormalizedCall
tracks a call's own bare-identifier arguments, not a cross-statement
def-use chain). Approximating "independent" as "textually adjacent await
statements" would risk false positives on genuinely sequential
awaits (the second explicitly depends on the first's result) -- an
unsound advisory is worse than no advisory for this repo's own
noise-discipline convention (T-0332).

Scope for this follow-up: `src/frob/arch/**`, `tests/unit/test_arch.py`,
`docs/modules/arch.md`. Build a minimal def-use check over two or more
sequential `await` statements in the same function body: an `await`
whose LHS binding is never read by any argument of a LATER `await`
expression in the same own-scope sequence is "independent"; suggest
`asyncio.gather` naming the awaited call sites. Same advisory-tier,
unwaivable-channel posture as every other T-0693 concurrency-hazard

T-0894's agent had to hand-edit tickets.md to add a before-fails/after-passes acceptance criterion required by the T-0756 new-gate-rule close gate, because no subcommand exists to append acceptance criteria to an existing ticket. Add e.g. 'frob ticket accept <id> --criterion ...' (or extend ticket scope-style editing) with the same validation as ticket new --acceptance, so the ledger is never hand-edited for this.

Three separate dispatch batches now had implementer worktrees cut from a stale base (origin tip b3589c3e era, or fa606fe8 -- 20+ files behind main): T-0958-era batch (2 agents), wave-9 gates-tests agent, wave-9 T-1018 agent (pre-filing tip). Playbook workaround (verify merge-base, git merge main) works but every agent pays it. Root-cause where the harness worktree-creation picks its base (likely origin/main or a cached default-branch ref while local main is 240+ commits ahead and never pushed) and document the definitive mitigation in the playbook; if the base choice is outside frob's control, make the playbook warm-up step a hard MUST with the exact two commands.

## Done report

Investigated directly rather than assuming: compared origin/main's tip
against local main's tip in this clone. origin/main was exactly fa606fe8
(one of the three reported stale bases) while local main was 81 commits
ahead and unpushed. Then isolated the mechanism by creating a worktree
two ways: (1) a plain `git worktree add <path> -b <branch> main` cut
correctly from local main's current tip (fc0edfc6), no staleness; (2)
the dispatch harness's own EnterWorktree tool documents its own default
(worktree.baseRef=fresh) as branching from origin/<default-branch>, not
local HEAD. That default, combined with origin/main never being kept in
sync with local main across a session, reproduces the exact observed
symptom byte-for-byte.

Root cause is confirmed to be harness-side (EnterWorktree's default base
selection), not frob code -- there is nothing in frob's codebase that
creates or influences worktree base selection for a dispatched agent, so
no code fix belongs to this ticket. Per the ticket's own INVESTIGATE-
then-fix framing, the honest disposition is: document the finding and
the concrete mitigation, and file separate tickets for the two follow-on
actions that are out of this ticket's docs-only scope (a settings.json
policy decision, and a frob-side lagging-worktree detector) rather than
silently expand scope to touch them here.

docs/guides/agent-playbook.md section 1 now states the root cause
explicitly, makes the two-command warm-up a hard MUST with the exact
commands, and names the two follow-up tickets. No frob source changed --
none was in scope, and none was warranted; the defect is not in this
codebase.

T-0735's user directive named "estate rollout via fleet at close" as part of
the natives-build epic: every sibling repo's Makefile core target should be
converted to the one-line `uv run frob natives build` shim (T-0864's landed
subcommand) via `frob scaffold apply` (T-0865's landed scaffold template +
drift check), removing any lingering per-repo CARGO_TARGET_DIR/maturin-develop
cache logic at the wrong layer (the exact T-0732 drift class this epic exists
to retire).

This repo itself is already compliant (Makefile `core:` is the one-line shim,
verified at T-0735's close: `uv run frob natives build` runs successfully
using the git-common-dir-keyed shared CARGO_TARGET_DIR).

Fleet-level rollout across the other frob-enabled repos is out of THIS repo's
own scope -- draft follow-up for whichever fleet-facing ticket/process
actually walks the sibling-repo list and runs `frob scaffold apply` +
`frob doctor` per repo, plus a short docs note pointing at T-0864/T-0865/
T-0735 as the design precedent for anyone doing that rollout by hand in the
meantime.

Found while working T-0658: `tests/test_registry_reconciliation_system_design.py::TestSystemDesignExhaustiveness::test_every_deferred_entry_targets_an_open_ticket` fails on a fresh worktree built from current main, unrelated to T-0658's own scope (docs/design/registry/system-design.yaml is a different scope than this test file, and neither was touched to cause this).

Root cause: the test asserts `deferred` (entries with `disposition.kind is DispositionKind.DEFERRED`) is non-empty in the live `docs/design/registry/system-design.yaml`. At the time T-0392 wrote this test, ~105 genuine entries were deferred to T-0331/a re-pointed successor. Since then, T-0958 (per system-design.yaml's own header comment) re-dispositioned all of them into `handled_by:RULE` (21 entries) or `out_of_scope:...` (97 entries) or `duplicate-of-artifact` (1 entry) -- the live file now has ZERO `deferred:` dispositions (verified directly: `frob.registry.audit_registry_file` reports `deferred=0`, `handled=21`, `out_of_scope=97`, `duplicate=1`, `unaccounted=0`, `exhausted=True`). The test's "expected at least one deferred entry to check against" assumption no longer holds -- not a regression in the registry file (it is MORE fully dispositioned now, a good outcome), but a stale assumption baked into the test itself.

Fix: either loosen the assertion to `if deferred:` (skip cleanly when zero, matching the file's now-fully-resolved state) or remove/replace the test with one that positively asserts the CURRENT resolved state, whichever the reviewer judges is the more honest signal for future drift. Scope: tests/test_registry_reconciliation_system_design.py only -- the registry file itself needs no change (it is honestly, fully dispositioned already).

```
Found while working T-0862 (tests/**-only frob-dup group triage).

4 of the 154 unaccounted tests/**-only groups measured for T-0862 share a
single root cause that cannot be fixed from tests/** alone: a symref
mismatch between how `frob.dup._legacy` names a NESTED (closure) function
fragment and how `frob.graph.dsl` binds a preceding `frob:waive` comment.

`frob.dup._legacy._enclosing_class_py` (src/frob/dup/_legacy.py via
src/frob/dup/_legacy_py.py:198) walks ALL the way up a function's ancestor
chain looking for the nearest enclosing CLASS, ignoring any enclosing
FUNCTION in between. So a helper closure defined inside a test method
(e.g. `def _run_new():` nested inside
`TestArchiveRaceWithConcurrentNew.test_concurrent_new_ticket_survives_a_racing_archive`)
gets a dup fragment symbol of `TestArchiveRaceWithConcurrentNew._run_new`
-- qualified by the enclosing CLASS only, never the enclosing METHOD.

Meanwhile `frob.graph.dsl`'s directive-to-symbol binding (used to resolve
a `frob:waive DUP001 reason="..."` comment placed directly above a `def`)
only tracks top-level defs and class methods as declared symbols -- it has
no concept of a nested closure as an independently addressable symbol. A
comment placed directly above a nested `def` binds instead to the nearest
OUTER tracked symbol (the enclosing test method), not the nested function.

Net effect: `_dup_group_covering_waivers`'s full-coverage rule
(docs/modules/dup.md#T-0375) requires every fragment's symref -- as
`frob.dup` computes it -- to be covered by a matching `frob:waive` edge --
as `frob.graph.dsl` binds it. For a nested-closure fragment these two
symbol spaces disagree, so no comment placement can ever satisfy coverage
for that fragment. Confirmed by direct probe (calling
`frob.check._python._waive_edges_for_rule` and `frob.dup.find_duplicates`
against this repo): a `frob:waive DUP001` comment placed immediately above
`tests/test_tickets_ledger_concurrency.py`'s nested `_run_new` binds to
`TestArchiveRaceWithConcurrentNew.test_concurrent_new_ticket_survives_a_racing_archive`
(the outer test method), never to
`TestArchiveRaceWithConcurrentNew._run_new` (the fragment `frob.dup`
actually reports) -- so the waiver is silently ineffective no matter where
the comment is placed.

A second, related symptom: two SAME-NAMED nested closures in different
test methods of the same class collapse to the SAME symref (class-only
qualification loses the enclosing-method disambiguation), e.g.
`tests/test_ticket_runner_pytest_env.py`'s two `fake_guarded_subprocess_run`
closures in `TestRunPytestDirectlyStripsLeaseEnv` both report as
`TestRunPytestDirectlyStripsLeaseEnv.fake_guarded_subprocess_run` --
genuinely ambiguous fragment identity, independent of the waiver-binding
gap above.

The 4 residual groups from T-0862 (unfixable from tests/** alone):
- tests/test_tickets_ledger_concurrency.py:98,156 (nested `_run_new`
  in two different test methods of two different classes)
- tests/test_testing.py:1239,2124 (nested `fake_run_argv`)
- tests/test_gitio.py:29 + 8 sibling files, incl.
  tests/test_evidence_integrity.py's nested `git` (the pre-existing
  waiver there already has this exact problem -- it predates T-0862)
- tests/test_ticket_runner_pytest_env.py:40,71 (symref collision, not
  just a binding gap)

Fix direction (not evaluated in depth, needs design):
(a) `frob.dup._legacy`'s Python function-symbol resolution: qualify a
    nested closure's symbol by its full enclosing chain (or at minimum
    the nearest enclosing FUNCTION, not just the nearest enclosing CLASS)
    so two same-named closures in sibling methods no longer collide.
(b) `frob.graph.dsl`'s comment-to-symbol binding: either extend it to
    recognize nested function defs as independently waivable symbols
    (binding a directly-preceding comment to the nested def rather than
    falling through to the outer tracked symbol), or teach
    `_dup_group_covering_waivers` to accept a waiver bound to a fragment's
    nearest OUTER tracked symbol as sufficient coverage for a nested
    fragment (weaker, but matches what a human intuitively expects when
    they place the comment directly above the nested closure).

Scope for whoever picks this up: src/frob/dup/_legacy.py,
src/frob/dup/_legacy_py.py, src/frob/graph/dsl.py, plus
docs/modules/dup.md's T-0375 full-coverage writeup once resolved. The 4
groups above (and the pre-existing evidence_integrity.py waiver, which
should be re-verified once the binding is fixed) are this ticket's
regression fixtures.

Root cause: REG011 was added by T-0680, which landed after T-0384's reconciliation test was written and pinned "zero violations" against `weaknesses.yaml`. T-0384 never anticipated this new WARN-level quality bar. `weaknesses.yaml`'s `out_of_scope:` dispositions (presumably many of its CWE `out-of-scope-naming-the-missing-concept` entries, per T-0346's own acceptance criterion [1] wording) apparently do not meet REG011's substantive-reason bar.

This is a real, live gate warning (not an error) affecting a file this session did not touch. Two possible fixes, for the reviewer to choose: (1) improve the ~798 flagged `out_of_scope` reason strings in weaknesses.yaml to satisfy REG011's substantive-disclosure bar (real remediation, likely large), or (2) if the reasons are already substantive and REG011's heuristic is simply too strict for this file's phrasing convention, adjust REG011 or file targeted waivers. Scope: docs/design/registry/weaknesses.yaml, tests/test_registry_reconciliation_weaknesses.py, possibly src/frob/gates/_registry_exhaustiveness.py (REG011 itself) depending on the reviewer's chosen direction.

T-1047 closed 17 of the ~25 taxonomy runtime-opaque gaps T-0666 found (15
new RUNTIME_OPAQUE_CONSTRUCTS needle-based detector entries across
python/typescript/c-cpp/rust/kotlin, plus 2 new rust OPAQUE_SOURCE_INVISIBLE
excuse entries for the extern-FFI-symbol and proc-macro-expansion rows).
The remaining gaps genuinely need MORE than a fixed-substring needle match
-- a generic "container subscript followed by a call" shape
(`handlers[key](x)`, `cp[key](x)`), or a real cast-expression / points-to
analysis (C integer-to-function-pointer cast, C void*-backcast,
C/C++ array-index-into-function-pointer-table with a runtime index) --
which `_opaque_indirection_findings`'s current architecture (a byte-level
needle scan with an optional single-literal-argument check, T-0665) cannot
express without either a full expression grammar or an unacceptable false
positive rate on ordinary bracket/call syntax. Extending that architecture
is real design work, not a registry-entry addition, so it is scoped
separately here rather than forced into T-1047's needle-table shape.

Remaining runtime-opaque taxonomy rows still with NO detector/excuse
(litmus fixtures already lock the current honest non-firing behavior in
tests/test_vet.py::TestOpaqueIndirectionGate, `_not_addressed` suffix):
- python: container-dynamic-key (`handlers[key](x)`)
- typescript: computed-member-non-constant-key (`cp[key](x)`),
  container-dynamic-key (`handlers[key](x)`)
- c: array-nonconstant-index, integer-cast-to-function-pointer,
  void-star-backcast
- cpp: array-runtime-index

Also carried forward from T-0666/T-1047, structural resolver gaps in the
ORDINARY (non-opaque-gate) resolver, `frob.vet._capability.scan_file_
capabilities` and friends -- litmus fixtures already lock these too:
- rust: struct-field points-to (struct-update field rebinding never
  resolves through a later call) --
  `test_struct_update_field_rebind_not_detected`
- rust: `macro_rules!` expansion (no macro-expansion-aware resolution
  exists for rust at all) --
  `test_macro_rules_expansion_emitting_fixed_call_not_detected`
- cpp: pointer-to-member alias tracking (`&Ops::run` / `.*`/`->*`
  dereference has no alias tracking) --
  `test_member_function_pointer_bound_to_named_member_not_detected`
- kotlin: destructuring-declaration alias tracking --

  `test_default_parameter_forwarding_callable_not_detected`
- kotlin: operator `fun invoke` / receiver-instance points-to --
  `test_operator_fun_invoke_making_object_directly_callable_not_detected`

Each needs either: (a) a generalized "subscript-then-call" detector shape
added to `_opaque_indirection_findings` (a new construct kind beyond the
current needle+literal-arg-index model), or (b) real points-to/alias
tracking added to the per-language ordinary resolvers (mirrors C's
existing `_record_c_field_alias` for the rust/cpp/kotlin cases). Until

  _record_c_field_alias which this ticket should generalize from)

  tracking at all)

Because these 13 rows are unaddressed, T-0339's acceptance criterion [1]
("given any RUNTIME-resolved indirection ... the analyzer FAILS CLOSED")
does not fully hold. T-0339 remains open until this closes (or until each
remaining row gets a reasoned OPAQUE_SOURCE_INVISIBLE excuse instead, if
investigation shows any of them are genuinely source-invisible per T-0665
doctrine rather than needing a detector/resolver).

## Description

DEPR005's new-caller ratchet red-mained three times in one session
(2026-07-27 night: re-baselines 54273735, 1ed269c1, plus a third hit
from T-0602's land) because BOTH of its axes are churn-hostile:

1. Reference DETECTION is a bare-short-name text match.
   `deprecated_current_references` matches the deprecated symbol's bare
   name, so for `src/frob/app/xref_runner.py::run` every
   `subprocess.run(`, gate-runner `.run(`, and any other textual `run`
   occurrence in the repo counts as a "caller" -- the committed baseline
   carries ~900 references per `run`-named symbol, nearly all junk
   (verified: the flagged "new callers" at
   tests/test_gates_tick009_tick010.py:86 and
   src/frob/app/ticket_runner.py:2206 are literally `subprocess.run`
   calls). Any land that ADDS a file containing `.run(` red-mains.

2. Baseline KEYING is file:line. Any land that edits lines ABOVE an
   existing reference shifts it, and the shifted line reads as a new
   caller (T-1023's test_gates.py edit produced 198 false errors at
   once; T-0714's land produced 6 more).

Fix both axes:
- Resolve references through the call graph / import resolution the way
  DEPR001-004 and the T-0639 caller-graph design doc already intend --
  a caller is an edge to THAT symbol, not a name coincidence.
  `frob.graph.callgraph.build_call_graph` is the shared substrate.
- Key the baseline line-insensitively: (referencing file, deprecated
  symbol) pairs, optionally with a per-file count for growth detection
  inside an already-referencing file. A pure line shift or an unrelated
  edit to a referencing file must NOT change the baseline identity.
- Regenerate the committed lock in the new format; drop the junk
  references that bare-name matching accumulated.
- Keep tighten_deprecated_baseline's shrink-only contract on the new
  key shape.

Until this lands, DEPR005 is demoted to warn in frob.toml
[gates.severity] (comment cites this ticket) -- three coordinator
re-stamps in 90 minutes is hand-maintenance of a broken signal, not
enforcement.

Three FP classes observed across the 2026-07 drive: (1) bare-method-name coincidence -- PERF002 flagged str.count on the loop's own per-iteration line in src/frob/arch/_cpp_mayraise.py (waived e69fd22d); same class produced the original PERF008 FP body lost twice to draft-renumber clobbers (see commits c00a8c1a / d9e51579 for the full catalogue: bare-method-name coincidence, receiver conflation, lru_cache blindness). (2) receiver conflation -- a rule keyed on method name attributes effects of one receiver's method to a different receiver. (3) lru_cache blindness -- repeated calls to a memoized function are flagged as repeated work. Each class should get a litmus fixture that locks current behavior before the fix, per the T-0666 pattern.

Recurring all through the 2026-07-27 drive: an agent's ticket start in a worktree writes the queued->in-progress line into ROOT tickets.md but never commits it; the next land (any agent) refuses with DirtyMain. Diagnosed explicitly during the T-1023 land (coordinator committed 52419399 by hand to unblock). land already owns its ledger commits; start should own its transition commit the same way.

Carved out of T-1024 (REF/COV/DEAD/PLACE small-bucket sweep). Both
PLACE001 findings sit in tests/unit/test_ticket_runner_gate_findings.py
(lines 78 and 279 as of T-1024's measurement): a frob: directive whose
fully-resolved binding falls back to the enclosing class/module rather
than the specific nearby symbol it plausibly intends.

T-1024's dispatch explicitly deferred this pair because
tests/unit/test_ticket_runner_gate_findings.py is scope-leased to T-0714
("ticket doable: relocate stale-lease/scope diagnostics to frob check"),
which is still `state: queued` (not landed) as of T-1024's close -- fixing
the two directive placements here would collide with T-0714's own planned
edits to the same file.

Fix: once T-0714 lands (or is confirmed abandoned), move the two
misplaced directives at tests/unit/test_ticket_runner_gate_findings.py:78
and :279 into their intended following-windows, then re-measure PLACE001
to zero.

T-1030 traced the stale-worktree-base incidents to the EnterWorktree
harness tool's default worktree.baseRef=fresh, which branches new
worktrees from origin/<default-branch> rather than local HEAD. In this
clone, origin/main is far behind local main (never pushed, 81 commits
behind at investigation time), so every fresh EnterWorktree cut lands on
the stale origin tip.

This is a settings.json change (worktree.baseRef: "head", or pushing
main to origin regularly to keep it in sync), not a frob code or docs
change, and not something this agent should apply silently mid-ticket.
Filed so a coordinator/user can decide: either flip worktree.baseRef to
"head" in .claude/settings.json, or adopt a habit of pushing local main
to origin before dispatching a wave, or both.

T-1030 investigated why dispatched agent worktrees were repeatedly cut from
a stale base (fa606fe8/b3589c3e). Root cause: the EnterWorktree harness
tool's default worktree.baseRef=fresh branches new worktrees from
origin/<default-branch>, and this clone's origin/main has not been kept in
sync with local main (observed 81 commits behind at investigation time).
This is harness-side behavior, outside frob's codebase, and cannot be
fixed by editing frob source.

Add a frob-side detector: frob ticket start (and/or frob check) warns
loudly when the worktree's merge-base with local main is more than N
commits behind main's current tip, pointing at the playbook's warm-up
section (docs/guides/agent-playbook.md#1-worktree-warm-up). This does not
prevent the stale cut but catches it immediately at the start of a
ticket instead of silently carrying it through a whole session.
