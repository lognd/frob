User mandate 2026-07-19: a frob deploy utility built into strata. The threat model: red teams compromise the one user that owns a service and nothing isolates that user -- lateral and vertical movement must be PROVABLY blocked, not hoped. The deployment sequence (idempotent install, status/health, uninstall with NO artifacts) must be auditable end to end, including an expensive opt-in VM-snapshot audit (VirtualBox) that is NOT part of make check. Scripts must tie into the model so hand edits are DETECTABLE through the strata checker, and the 'weird layer between the OS and the backend' (users, groups, units, ownership, ports) becomes provable architecture. Children: std.host OS-layer modeling -> movement-impossibility proofs + deploy script generation -> script<->model conformance gate -> VM snapshot audit harness -> real-service pilot (malmberg) remediating its awkward setup. Umbrella closes when all children close.

T-0254 child 6 (proof on reality). Apply the full chain to malmberg (the real server product from pilot P3: server_api/ingest/cloudsync/faces/backup/display + media_store): extend design/malmberg.strata with std.host (dedicated service users per component, units, ownership of media_store paths, ports), prove HOST001/HOST002 movement-impossibility or record honest waivers, generate the deploy scripts, run the conformance gate, and if a VirtualBox environment is available run the full VM snapshot audit and attach the attestation. Remediate the current awkward setup step in malmberg's docs/scripts with the generated sequence. Work happens IN THE MALMBERG REPO per the break-and-report pilot protocol (frob-side gaps come back as tickets, filed serially by the coordinator); this frob-side ticket tracks the campaign and collects the gap list. Success = malmberg installs/uninstalls via generated scripts with a green conformance gate and a documented (or executed) VM audit path.

Sunset-execution ticket for the user's 2026-07-23 deprecation decision (T-0580, done). Stays OPEN until the sunset so the four frob:deprecated directives have a live ticket binding (DEPR002 requires ticket= to reference an open ticket -- T-0797 registration surfaced that the directives bound to the closed T-0580). Do not work before the sunset date.

T-0399's gates-quality audit (docs/audits/gates-quality.md) found the
entire quality/security-advisory surface (PERF001-004, PII010/012, SEC110,
ARCH001, DUP) is WARN-tier and non-blocking, so a green `frob check` makes
no quality claim. T-0399 executed the promotable-now slice (DUP fail-
closed behavior) and measured live warning counts per family. This epic
parents the burn-down children needed before each remaining family can be
safely promoted to ERROR without redding main.

User directive 2026-07-28: refactors today mean an agent hand-editing every import and callsite, and -- the expensive part -- hand-carrying frob's symbol-attached bookkeeping. Second user directive same day: the rewrite must ALSO cover frob symbols and symbols in comments -- auto-documentation updating -- because a rename that fixes code but strands docs/docstring/comment mentions just converts silent breakage into doc drift (the DRIFT001/DOC006 class this repo keeps paying down). Evidence from this drive: 3 coordinator INV006 waiver carries in one wave (0abc4e3a), PII012 allowlist re-keying on every move (T-1076), the ARCH101/103 waiver-symref path:: bug where moved waivers never matched again, archived evidence repoints after litmus renames (8dae48c5), DRIFT002 edge repoints. frob owns the graph/binding/exports substrate to do this transactionally. Python first; the multi-language binding tables (TS/Rust/C-C++/Kotlin) extend it later. Children to file at design time: reference-rewrite engine, directive/waiver carrier (absorbs T-1134), registry/evidence repointer, split verb built on the T-1072/T-1077 family-extraction pattern, alias-conflict policy. Relationship: makes T-1108/T-1115-class split tickets mechanical.

```
User directive 2026-07-28: too much manual work rides on tickets.md mechanics. The monofile is the root cause of a documented incident museum: land splice regression (T-0577), archive clobber (T-0959), ledger churn rewrites (T-1036), id collision (T-1090), draft deaths in 10b restores (4 coordinator refiles on 2026-07-28 alone: T-1115, T-1126, T-1127, T-1128), DirtyMain transitions (T-1054), hand splices where the merge driver is unregistered in worktrees, ledger-lock starvation and deadlocks (T-0933, T-0982). Per-ticket files make disjoint tickets disjoint git objects so merge/lease/draft/renumber/archive become ordinary git operations. The global convention (tickets/ tracked in git) already names the directory form. Design doc in docs/design/ first; migration is a separate child with golden round-trip tests; T-1125 (draft-id prose rewrite) stays valuable pre-migration and its engine is reusable for renumber-with-references after.

User directive 2026-07-28: the annoying errors are the ones whose fix is mechanical but manual.

Design doc first (docs/design/): fix-handler protocol per rule id, transaction/rollback model, interaction with frob doctor (inventory what doctor already repairs and fold or delegate), daemon-warm --fix, and the two anti-goals (no auto-waivers ever; no threshold loosening ever).

## Description

T-1189 extracted ONE cohesive family (the union-zone conflict-block
resolution machinery: `_UnionZone`/`_zone_for_path`/`_union_keyed_chunks`/
`_union_append_only`/`_resolve_conflict_blocks`/
`_resolve_union_zone_conflicts`) out of _land_merge.py into a new
src/frob/tickets/_land_merge_zones.py (1722 -> 1506 lines), continuing the
same one-family-per-land discipline T-1186/T-1187/T-1188 established.
Budget did not allow the other seams T-1189's own plan named.
_land_merge.py is still 1506 lines and _land_finalize.py is still 1735
lines, both above the 800-line LARGE001 threshold.

Still remaining, in the same one-family-per-land shape:

- `_land_merge.py`: the ledger-merge/newest-wins family (`splice_ledger`,
  `_merge_ledger_tickets`, `_resolve_divergence`, `_newer`/`_newer_winner`/
  `_richness`, `_union_evidence`/`_union_acceptance`,
  `_drop_resurrected_ids`, `_preserve_sibling_done_reports`,
  `_carry_forward_new_worktree_tickets`, `_overlay_landed_ticket`,
  `_splice_only_ticket`) vs. the git-plumbing/wip-commit family
  (`_merge_main_into_worktree`, `_auto_resolve_out_of_scope_conflicts`,
  `_wip_commit`/`_wip_add_excluding_frob`/`_do_wip_commit`,
  `_splice_and_stage`/`_splice_and_stage_archive`, `_verify_archive_merge`,
  `_rev_parse`/`_true_merge_base`) -- the deletion-authorization pair
  (`_deletion_glob_too_broad`/`_deletion_owned`) can go with whichever side
  ends up using `_unowned_deletions`.
- `_land_finalize.py`: draft-finalization/sibling-renumbering vs.
  squash-apply/close vs. the release-bump/uv.lock/native-rebuild family
  (T-1189's own plan named this split, not yet started).

Re-filed (not re-derived from scratch) rather than letting T-1189 close
with silent residue, per TICK011.

- src/frob/vet/_scan.py (901)

(src/frob/tickets/_new_renumber.py dropped off this list -- T-1192
brought it under the 800-line threshold.)

## Plan

Same discipline as T-1072/T-1074/T-1186/T-1187/T-1188/T-1189/T-1192: pick
a cohesive subsystem slice per land, split it (or record an
accepted-with-reason disposition per T-1074's precedent if no safe seam
exists), full verification per group, re-measure, re-file remaining
residue rather than closing silently. LARGE001 is a warning-tier,
waivable advisory (`frob:waive LARGE001 reason="..."`, file-level since a
file-level finding has no symref) -- not every file on this list needs a
structural split; a disposition is a valid, honest outcome where a real
split boundary would fragment a genuinely cohesive module (T-1074's own
precedent for the 7 files it dispositioned rather than split).

Design: docs/design/refactor-verb.md (T-1135). Build the shared
resolve/plan/apply/verify transaction pipeline for `frob refactor`:

- Resolve phase: given a Python move/rename/split target, use frob.lang +
  frob.graph to locate the symbol(s) unambiguously; refuse with no writes
  if the target does not resolve or a destination name collision has no
  --alias-conflict policy given (policy itself is T-1135's alias-conflict
  child; this ticket just exposes the extension point).
- Plan phase: build the full rewrite plan (import/call-site rewrites incl.
  auto-alias on conflict, absolute-import form) before any file write.
- Apply phase: AST-level move preserving formatting outside the moved
  span; rewrite Python import/call sites; commit as one WIP commit in the
  caller's own worktree (never git stash, per agent-playbook.md sec 1b).
- Verify phase: import graph resolves (frob.graph rebuild + import
  resolution check), pytest --collect-only succeeds with no new
  collection error, frob check --delta against a pre-refactor baseline
  stamp is diff-clean (identity-aware: a finding that moved with its
  symref is not "new").
- Rollback: any verify-phase failure does `git reset --hard` to the
  pre-transaction commit inside the caller's own worktree (never touches
  refs/stash) and prints the disclosed report (attempted rewrites, why it
  could not complete).
- New CLI verb `frob refactor move`/`frob refactor rename` (split is a
  separate child), with docs/commands/refactor.md added following the
  existing docs/commands/*.md per-command convention.
- This ticket owns ONLY the Python-import/call-site reference kind and
  the shared pipeline; frob-owned DSL/waiver/registry/evidence rewriting
  is out of scope (children 2 and 3 extend this pipeline's reference-kind
  inventory, they do not reimplement resolve/plan/apply/verify).

frob:channel, frob:boundary, frob:secret, frob:protocol, frob:transition,
frob:requires, frob:acquire, frob:release, frob:escapes -- the full
frob.graph.dsl._VERB_TABLE), using frob.graph.dsl's existing parser, not a
second regex.

Also rewrites `frob:waive RULE reason="..."` `src` symrefs, preserving
frob.gates._waive._match_waiver's three matching modes (per-symbol exact
symref, file-scoped, package/system-prefix) -- a waiver's src is itself a
symref that must move with the same rules as a frob:doc target. This is
the direct fix for the ARCH101/103 waiver-symref path:: bug named in
T-1135's epic body.

Carries frob.lock ack entries forward: an ack keyed on (symbol identity,
digest) at the old symref, where the digest is unchanged by the move,
gets re-keyed to the new symref rather than going stale.

Scope note: this ticket rewrites directive/waiver TARGETS repo-wide (per
epic acceptance [2] -- a directive anywhere in the repo pointing at the
moved symbol, not just directives attached to the moved symbol's own
code) but does not move the owning code itself; T-1197 (or the split
verb, T-1201) does that.

Design: docs/design/refactor-verb.md (T-1135). Extends T-1197's plan/apply
pipeline with the three remaining non-DSL reference kinds named in the
epic:

- PII012 (file, token) allowlist entries: locate the exact storage first
  (src/frob/gates/_pii_structural/ is the closest hit found during design
  survey -- confirm the exact file/data shape before writing the repoint
  logic), then re-key any entry whose file half matches a moving path to
  the new path, token half unchanged (T-1076 precedent for why this keeps
  breaking by hand today).
- check-coverage registry citations (docs/design/registry/*.yaml,
  handled_by/caught_by, read by frob.gates._registry_exhaustiveness
  REG004-011): survey whether any registry entry embeds a literal
  path::qualname string outside a frob:enforces edge (the directive
  carrier, T-1199, already keeps frob:enforces targets correct via the
  DSL rewrite -- this ticket only needs to cover a citation that is NOT
  reachable that way, if one exists).
- Archived-ticket evidence node ids: pytest node ids and path::Class.method
  forms recorded in tickets.md Done-report/Evidence sections and in
  tickets-archive.md, for any ticket (open or archived) whose evidence
  cites a symref that is moving. Both files, not just the live ledger.

This ticket owns the "everything the directive carrier's DSL rewrite
cannot reach" residue -- coordinate with T-1199 to avoid double-rewriting
a citation that IS reachable via frob:enforces.

```
Design: docs/design/refactor-verb.md (T-1135). New `frob refactor split`
verb, built directly on the T-1072/T-1077 manual family-extraction
pattern used repeatedly this drive (private sibling module per cohesive
family, old module re-imports/re-exports every moved name UNCHANGED so
external `from frob.x import y` call sites never change, frob:* directives
travel with the moved code, DRIFT002/AFFECT001 doc/test references
updated, land incrementally with full-suite verification per chunk).

Depends on T-1197 (resolve/plan/apply/verify pipeline), T-1199 (directive/
waiver carrier), and T-1200 (registry/evidence repointer) all being
callable, since a split is a move of N symbols at once plus generation of
the re-export shim in the source module.

Scope for this ticket: the split-specific pieces only --
- CLI surface: `frob refactor split SOURCE_MODULE --symbols a,b,c --into
  NEW_MODULE` (exact flag shape TBD during implementation).
- Re-export shim generation in the source module (a well-formed `from
  .new_module import a, b, c  # noqa: F401`-style re-export block,
  matching the exact shape T-1072/T-1077 hand-wrote).
- Chunked apply: a split naming many symbols applies and verifies in
  batches (mirroring T-1072/T-1077's own "land incrementally, verify
  after each chunk" discipline) rather than one all-or-nothing giant
  diff, while still being one refuse-and-rollback transaction per chunk
  (not per whole split) per T-1135's transaction model.
- Re-running T-1197/T-1199/T-1200's move/rewrite machinery per symbol
  moved, not reimplementing rewrite logic here.

```
Design: docs/design/refactor-verb.md (T-1135). T-1197's plan/apply
pipeline needs an extension point for handling an import-site name
collision when a destination name is already bound; this ticket owns
that policy layer: the naming scheme for auto-generated aliases, the
`--alias-conflict {error,rename-dest}` flag (default: error -- a
destination-namespace collision is a hard refusal, never a silent
auto-rename of the destination module's own symbol), and the disclosed
alias report format (every auto-generated import alias named, so a human
reviews it rather than discovering it later in a diff).

Depends on T-1197 exposing the plan-phase hook this policy plugs into
(a callback invoked once per detected collision, returning either an
alias name or a refusal).

Design: docs/design/refactor-verb.md (T-1135), "Prose-rewrite scope"
section. Filed per coordinator review of the design phase: T-1199
(directive/waiver carrier) covers only structured `frob:*` comment-DSL
directive targets; epic acceptance [2] also requires rewriting free text
that merely NAMES a moved symbol, which no filed child owned until now.

Extends T-1197's plan/apply pipeline with the three prose-rewrite items:

- Docstrings and comments naming the moved dotted path, anywhere in the
  repo, not just on the moved symbol's own code (e.g. "see
  `frob.gates._waive._match_waiver` for..." written in some unrelated
  module's docstring).
- `docs/**` prose and embedded code references: prose sentences naming
  the old module/symbol, and fenced code blocks citing the old import
  path.
- Doc anchor slugs whose heading text embeds the symbol/module name
  (a heading literally titled with a module name changes its own slug
  on rename) -- verified against `frob.gates._doclink_docanchor`'s
  `doclink_gate`/`docanchor_gate` (DOC001/DOC002) as the post-condition
  proof that no anchor broke.

Per the epic's acceptance [2], an unresolvable prose mention (ambiguous
natural-language mention, a name that is also a common English word, a
mention inside a generated/vendored file) must be listed explicitly in
the disclosed report as "not rewritten -- review by hand", never
silently skipped and never silently rewritten on a guess.

This ticket owns ONLY the free-text prose/doc-anchor rows; it does not
touch `frob:*` DSL directive targets (T-1199's scope) or the Python
import/call-site rewrite (T-1197's scope).
