User directive 2026-07-18: the pass-line counters hide real debt -- frob-exports reports 12-253 public symbols missing from __init__.py per package (decide policy: export or demote to private, per package, no blanket waiver), frob-dup 64 duplicate groups (triage: real extraction candidates vs false pairs; feeds T-0187 tree), frob-arch 197 warnings + 123 suggestions (long-function/god-class residue post-calibration -- fix or waive with reasons), perf gate 174 violations (166 waived -- re-audit every waiver still holds after T-0161's heuristic fixes land; the 8 unwaived need real fixes). Deliverable: each family driven to a state where the summary line is HONEST -- zero unwaived findings or a written per-finding reason; no threshold-loosening without a disclosed decision. Split into child tickets per family if any single family exceeds a session of work -- this ticket is the umbrella and the accounting.

User mandate 2026-07-19: a frob deploy utility built into strata. The threat model: red teams compromise the one user that owns a service and nothing isolates that user -- lateral and vertical movement must be PROVABLY blocked, not hoped. The deployment sequence (idempotent install, status/health, uninstall with NO artifacts) must be auditable end to end, including an expensive opt-in VM-snapshot audit (VirtualBox) that is NOT part of make check. Scripts must tie into the model so hand edits are DETECTABLE through the strata checker, and the 'weird layer between the OS and the backend' (users, groups, units, ownership, ports) becomes provable architecture. Children: std.host OS-layer modeling -> movement-impossibility proofs + deploy script generation -> script<->model conformance gate -> VM snapshot audit harness -> real-service pilot (malmberg) remediating its awkward setup. Umbrella closes when all children close.

T-0254 child 6 (proof on reality). Apply the full chain to malmberg (the real server product from pilot P3: server_api/ingest/cloudsync/faces/backup/display + media_store): extend design/malmberg.strata with std.host (dedicated service users per component, units, ownership of media_store paths, ports), prove HOST001/HOST002 movement-impossibility or record honest waivers, generate the deploy scripts, run the conformance gate, and if a VirtualBox environment is available run the full VM snapshot audit and attach the attestation. Remediate the current awkward setup step in malmberg's docs/scripts with the generated sequence. Work happens IN THE MALMBERG REPO per the break-and-report pilot protocol (frob-side gaps come back as tickets, filed serially by the coordinator); this frob-side ticket tracks the campaign and collects the gap list. Success = malmberg installs/uninstalls via generated scripts with a green conformance gate and a documented (or executed) VM audit path.

Expands T-0177 into a long-lived per-project daemon that holds warm, incrementally-maintained state (obligation graph + per-symbol digests, test collection, coverage, dup analysis, gate results) and serves it to all clients (agents, make, MCP, CI) via single-flight execution + a content-addressed result cache. Root cause it solves (observed live over a long multi-agent session): N parallel agents each redundantly recompute the same expensive state (make core, make coverage ~5min each, frob check 114s stages, ticket sweep dup-scan ~90s) in isolated worktrees with no sharing, and background-then-stall on make coverage. Children: (a) warm graph + FS-watch incremental invalidation by digest; (b) single-flight coverage/collection keyed by source digest, shared across worktrees with identical content; (c) local unix-socket JSON-RPC query protocol; (d) frob CLI auto-proxies to the daemon if running, else in-process (make targets become thin shims); (e) subscribe/push events (coverage-fresh, graph-changed) -- the stall-killer; (f) resource leases/semaphores (coverage=1 writer). MCP becomes one frontend over the same core. See the design discussion 2026-07-19.


## Integration / replacement map (2026-07-19 -- surveyed all subcommands + queue)
The daemon is a warm SUBSTRATE under most read/analysis subcommands, not a new silo.

SUBCOMMANDS -> daemon relationship:
- Warm GRAPH QUERIES (served instantly from the warm graph, zero recompute):
  outline, map, xref, parse, graph, exports, bind, docs, stats -- become thin daemon reads.
- Warm ANALYSIS (incremental, single-flight, cached by digest): dup, arch, perf, vet.
- Warm GATE eval (touched-set, the expensive path): check, sys, test, ticket(sweep/doable/evidence).
- FRONTENDS over one core: `serve` (MCP) becomes ONE frontend; the unix-socket JSON-RPC API is
  another; the `frob` CLI proxies to the daemon if running (make targets stay thin shims).
- One-shot / orthogonal (stay plain CLI; may read from daemon): scaffold, cycle, release, mutate,
  gitlog, ack, deploy.

EXISTING TICKETS the daemon SUBSUMES or de-risks (fold in as children/deps of this epic):
- T-0177 (incremental gate eval over warm graph) -- the SEED; this epic generalizes it. SUPERSEDES.
- T-0245 (stat storms + sqlite contention on /mnt/c, 13-60x tax) -- warm in-memory state + a single
  sqlite owner eliminate the re-stat/contention entirely. SUBSUMED (or its standalone fix becomes the
  daemon's storage layer).
- T-0243 (cache.db not invalidated across frob/parser upgrades) -- daemon owns cache lifecycle
  (digest + tool-version keyed). INTEGRATED.
- T-0279 (frob:tests direction disagrees: fresh dsl parse vs stale graph cache) -- daemon keeps the
  graph always-fresh, so the entire stale-cache class disappears. INTEGRATED.
- T-0180 (vetted-library cache engine) -- daemon holds the vet cache warm. INTEGRATED.
- T-0242 (frob test -> native sys audit on touched .strata) -- daemon touched-set orchestration. CHILD.
- T-0322 (coverage --wait / single-flight) + T-0324 (parametrized evidence) -- steps toward the daemon;
  0322 is the stall-killer extractable first. T-0292/T-0298 (evidence/collection resolution) become
  trivial once collection is warm. RELATED.
- T-0178 (agentic time profiling) -- the daemon is the natural instrumentation point. RELATED.
- T-0325 (doc-drift digest graph) -- the daemon's HEADLINE query (what code/docs must update when X
  changes); only practical warm. CHILD.
- T-0323 (git merge driver for tickets.md) -- INDEPENDENT of the daemon; do first regardless.


## Client-interface design constraints (HARD requirements: no init/deinit, impossible to misuse)
The daemon is a TRANSPARENT ACCELERATOR, never a thing the user/agent manages. Non-negotiable:

1. NO lifecycle commands in the happy path. There is NO `frob daemon start` / `stop` / `init` a
   client must run first. You just run `frob <cmd>` (or `make check`, or an MCP call) and it works.
   (A `frob daemon status`/`stop` MAY exist for debugging, but nothing REQUIRES them.)
2. TRANSPARENT AUTOSTART: the first query that could benefit spawns the daemon if none is running,
   via an atomic single-instance guard (flock/socket-bind on a .frob/ lockfile) so racing clients
   resolve to exactly one daemon -- never an "already running" error, never two daemons.
3. AUTO-SHUTDOWN on idle (N min) and on project-dir removal. No orphaned processes; nothing to clean
   up. Killing the daemon at any moment loses NOTHING (all durable state is content-addressed on disk).
4. CORRECTNESS MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE DAEMON (the #1 safety invariant): a daemon-served result MUST
   equal the in-process result, always -- the daemon only makes it FASTER. Enforce with single-flight
   + digest-keyed cache + FS-watch invalidation, and a property/differential test that daemon-answer
   == cold-answer for every query type. A stale-cache-served-as-fresh is the cardinal failure -- attack
   it in review (races, watch-miss, clock skew) like a security bug.
5. TRANSPARENT FALLBACK: if the daemon is unreachable / crashed / a STALE frob VERSION (post-upgrade)
   / times out, the client SILENTLY falls back to in-process computation (and best-effort restarts a
   fresh daemon). The client NEVER hangs and NEVER surfaces a daemon error for a normal command.
6. SELF-HEALING VERSION SKEW: on a frob/parser upgrade the client detects the running daemon's version
   mismatch and the daemon self-replaces (ties to T-0243/T-0279) -- no manual restart, no stale cache.
7. ZERO required config; opt-OUT only (e.g. FROB_NO_DAEMON=1 forces in-process). Works on a fresh clone
   with no setup step -- this is exactly the 'no awkward setup step' the frob owner wants everywhere.

Acceptance: a fresh clone runs `frob check` with the daemon auto-managed end-to-end, no init/deinit
command ever issued; kill -9 the daemon mid-use -> next command transparently succeeds (respawn or
in-process); daemon-answer == cold-answer differential test green for every served query; FROB_NO_DAEMON=1
fully bypasses it with identical results.

frob arch today has per-language walkers (_python.py, _cpp.py) only. To extend cleanly (not N copies of each check), introduce a NORMALIZED CODE MODEL: a language-agnostic view (module, class, function, method, param, branch, loop, call, import, override, field-access, return, raise/throw, catch) that each language adapter maps its tree-sitter grammar onto. Checks are written ONCE against the model; adapters supply per-grammar node-type maps. Then add adapters for TypeScript, Rust, Kotlin (Kotlin needs tree-sitter-kotlin added to frob.lang; ts/rust/cpp/c already parse via tree-sitter-language-pack). Language-specific checks (Rust must_use/ownership, TS any/strict-null) live in per-language extensions on top of the shared model. Acceptance: an arch check written once fires correctly across python+ts+rust+kotlin on equivalent code; Kotlin grammar wired; the existing python/cpp checks refactored onto the model with no regression. Children: normalized-model, ts-adapter, rust-adapter, kotlin-grammar+adapter.

User mandate (2026-07-20): 'ensure that you stop ALL methods EXHAUSTIVELY across ALL LANGUAGES of evading detection. ENSURE THAT IT IS 100% EXHAUSTIVE via LANGUAGE SPEC.' HONEST ARCHITECTURE (recorded so no one later mistakes the goal for the impossible one): a sound STATIC analyzer cannot resolve runtime dispatch (getattr/eval/reflection/dynamic-require/fn-ptr-from-data) -- Rice's theorem. So 'exhaustive' means: (1) EXHAUSTIVE-RESOLVE the DECIDABLE fragment -- enumerate FROM EACH LANGUAGE SPEC every static name-binding/aliasing/re-export/copy construct (imports, import-as, from-import[-as], star-import, local + chained + attribute rebinding, destructuring, tuple/list unpack, Rust use/use-as/pub use, C/C++ #define + using-decl + function-pointer init from a named fn + typedef'd fn-ptr, Kotlin import-as + ::ref + typealias) and resolve calls through all of them, transitively, per-scope, cycle-guarded, WITHOUT regressing shadowing soundness (a benign/param binding must stay silent); (2) FAIL CLOSED on the UNDECIDABLE fragment -- every spec-defined runtime-resolved indirection becomes an 'opaque capability indirection' obligation (fires, requires a reasoned waiver), consistent with strata's prove-or-reject philosophy (T-0290 recursion, arch-override). DELIVERY: (a) dispatch exhaustive-research to produce the per-language evasion denominator from the actual specs (the coverage denominator for acceptance 1) + the opaque-construct list (acceptance 2); (b) child tickets per language implementing the static resolver to its denominator + litmus; (c) one child for the fail-closed opaque-indirection obligation in the scanner/strata may-analysis; (d) a cross-language exhaustiveness meta-test binding each denominator entry to its litmus (fails if a construct has no fixture, like the CVE catalog drift-lock). T-0337 (Python local rebind) and T-0328 (Python import resolution) are the first two leaves. This is the 'you cannot get around it' guarantee the whole tool exists for.

EXHAUSTIVENESS DRIFT-LOCK (T-0343, 2026-07-20 mandate 'implementation MUST address EVERYTHING the exhaustive researcher found'): this epic's implementation binds to the corpus DENOMINATOR MANIFEST via T-0343's N:M coverage meta-test.

The user asked (2026-07-20): 'what mechanisms enforce conformance to the .strata file? Do we force every module to declare its purpose and interface?' -- and to harden it adversarially. Design north-star: docs/design/structural-linter-adversarial-hardening.md. Today _code_binding.py (bind_code/ConformanceReport/check_import_conformance) and _effects.py::check_capability_conformance exist, and T-0331 already mandates 'NO obligation satisfied by bare declaration' -- but conformance is NOT TOTAL, which is the evasion surface: (1) un-modeled modules escape all obligations; (2) a node can declare a partial interface while the code exports more; (3) nothing binds a module's PURPOSE to an allowed-effect profile; (4) binding need not be total, so logic can be laundered into an unbound file. This epic closes those into the five acceptance criteria above (SYS-COV coverage totality, exact interface conformance, purpose contract, binding totality + effect conformance, bounded escape hatches + gated config), each a child ticket. Soundness rests entirely on the exhaustive binding-aware scanner (T-0328/T-0337/T-0339) -- this epic is the conformance layer ON TOP of that foundation. Coincident with the arch epic (T-0330) and strata-systems epic (T-0331); this is the 'the model cannot lie about the code' guarantee made total.

User critique (2026-07-20): the corpora hedged where the mandate is to EXHAUST -- e.g. security-corpus skipped CWE-1000 as 'repo spam' when the intent is to enumerate ALL ~900, categorize each, and reason mitigation per entry; and information split across 10 docs/design/*.md files means an item can exist in one file's prose but be absent from the enforceable denominator ('miss split across two files'). This epic makes the corpus a REGISTRY, not a reading list: (1) a single canonical machine-readable registry aggregating every corpus manifest with stable ids + cross-refs (pattern<->trap<->evasion<->mitigation linked by id); (2) a reconciliation/consolidation pass that de-dups cross-file and flags any prose-only entry; (3) completion of the bulk-skipped enumerations to per-entry disposition; (4) T-0343 (exhaustiveness drift-lock) bound to the registry with a mandatory per-entry disposition. Governs T-0330/331/332/339/341/343 and all the corpus docs. The corpora already emit '## DENOMINATOR MANIFEST' sections (per-doc TOTAL); this epic unifies them into one registry and closes the 'seems like spam so I skipped it' and 'split across two files' gaps permanently.

_scan_file_fingerprints (CVE matching) is lexical needle-matching for EVERY language including Python -- a renamed import defeats a fingerprint even where capability scanning is binding-aware. Reuse the binding tables built for capability resolution (Python + the new TS/Rust/C-C++ tables) to resolve aliases before fingerprint matching for all languages. Acceptance: an aliased import that would evade a lexical fingerprint match is still caught; adversarial test per language.

Triage the 37 frob-arch abstraction-opportunity advisories: for each genuine near-duplicate or specific-signature family, either extract the real shared code into one home, or add an explicit reason-note accepting the duplication. Acceptance: frob check arch advisories for abstraction-opportunity reduced to zero unresolved (each is either fixed or reason-noted).

Full-repo pessimistic capability audit (2026-07-20, 7 read-only auditors). North-Star: if frob check / a ticket-close / a strata proof passes, the thing it claims must ACTUALLY hold. The audit found the North-Star is violated in concrete ways across subsystems. Each subsystem audit gets an umbrella child holding its full findings table; each HIGH finding gets an actionable child. Findings files live in the audit run; this epic is the durable tracked home so the audit itself does not become an orphaned document (the exact failure mode that motivated it). Consolidation in progress as the 7 auditors land: tickets/testing (evidence integrity), strata (vacuous proofs), graph/edges, gates-accounting, gates-quality/security, vet (lexical resolution), lang/check/docs.

Deferred remainder of T-0177 deliverable 2. The warm daemon caches graph snapshot, baseline, and collected test ids, and frob_check_delta filters full-run results against the stamped baseline -- but run_gates itself still evaluates EVERY gate in full on each call. Build per-obligation input tracking inside gate dispatch so a delta call evaluates only obligations whose inputs changed, with the verify=True cold-diff mode as the correctness oracle (incremental results must provably match a cold frob check). NOTE: T-0177's Done report references this as T-0602 (ex-draft, id lost at land); the draft block did not survive  (same draft-loss failure as T-0401's draft -- T-0577 tracks the land-time fix), so this ticket is its real replacement.

Extend the capability graph (T-0328-resolved) to enumerate every module with an observed capability effect, then cross-check against strata node bindings. A capable-but-unbound module is a hard obligation failure -- this closes acceptance-criterion (1) 'un-modeled modules escape all obligations'.

Extend SYS100/SYS101/SYS102 so the bound-set is provably total against the capability graph: a module reachable via import/call from a bound node but itself unbound must not silently escape effect-conformance checking -- closes acceptance-criterion (4) 'binding need not be total, so logic can be laundered into an unbound file'.

Compute a per-function may-raise set: explicit raise sites + resolved callees' sets propagated over the call graph + curated builtin-raiser table (dict[k]->KeyError, int()->ValueError, attr->AttributeError, ...). Unresolvable calls (dynamic dispatch, getattr, plugins) contribute an Unknown marker FAIL-CLOSED, per the T-0339 doctrine -- reuse its per-language resolvers (T-0659..T-0664), do not build a second binding analysis. Ubiquitous asynchronous exceptions (MemoryError, KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit) live in a separate always-possible tier that exhaustiveness never demands enumerated (only a boundary catch-all may discharge). The normalized model's NormalizedRaise/NormalizedCatch events (T-0609..T-0612) are the substrate. Children: Python may-raise resolver, C++ may-throw + noexcept obligation, exhaustive-handling gate + errors-as-values advisory. Umbrella closes when children close.

User mandate 2026-07-22: static checks for multiprocessing/threading/async code. Not a soundness claim -- a STRUCTURAL may-analysis over the call graph + normalized model (T-0609..T-0612) catching the classes that actually bite, fail-closed on opaque dispatch per T-0339 doctrine. Field motivation from this very session: the ProcessPoolExecutor-inside-ThreadPoolExecutor deadlock (T-0265 disclosure, T-0581 structural fix, T-0692 CI guard) ate a 6h CI job. Children: lock-order graph, fork/pool structural hazards, async event-loop hazards, shared-mutable-state approximation, IO/CPU-bound model-mismatch advisory. Umbrella closes when children close.

Child 4 of T-0693. Approximate data-race detection: a WRITE to module-level or class-level mutable state (assignment, mutating method on list/dict/set) on a call path reachable from a thread target/executor submission/async task, where no lock acquisition encloses the write in that path's context, is an advisory finding (suggestion tier -- approximation, false positives possible; waivable with reason). Reuses the lock-identification machinery from T-0694 and thread-target reachability from T-0695. Single-process cousin of strata's distributed no-shared-mutable-state check (T-0656) -- coordinate rule naming, do not duplicate its model-level logic.

Child 5 of T-0693, the user's seem-IO-bound/seem-CPU-bound mandate. Classify each function from normalized-model events: IO-BOUND if dominated by curated IO calls (sockets/files/http/subprocess/db), CPU-BOUND if loop/arithmetic-dense with no IO, MIXED/UNKNOWN otherwise (advisories only fire on confident classifications -- T-0332 noise discipline). Advisories: CPU-bound work submitted to ThreadPoolExecutor or awaited in the event loop -> GIL-bound, suggest ProcessPool/native; trivially-small IO-bound tasks under ProcessPoolExecutor -> IPC overhead, suggest threads/async; async def with zero awaits (from T-0696) -> not actually async, suggest plain def; sequential awaits over independent IO -> suggest gather. Each advisory names the classification evidence (the dominating call sites), never a bare switch-your-model.

User mandate 2026-07-22: contention semantics are worthless unless ENFORCED -- a declared mode nothing verifies is the catalogued-is-not-enforced trap (T-0343 doctrine). For every node with code= bindings and a declared resource mode (T-0700 grammar), join the declaration against the code's OBSERVED effects (the T-0595 code-binding pattern, wired to production per T-0630; effect classification from the vet/T-0339 capability resolvers): READ = zero write-capable operations against the resource (write-mode opens, os.remove/rename, SQL DML, sends on the port) -- fail-closed on opaque access to the resource; APPEND = writes only via append-mode opens, no truncate/rewrite; ALPHA (update/upgradeable-lock intent, user-specified) = reads freely, but every observed WRITE against the resource must be provably preceded on the same path by an upgrade acquisition (alpha->write transition through the declared arbiter) -- a write reachable while still in alpha-only context fails closed; additionally the model-level alpha+alpha exclusion (at most one alpha declarant per resource) is checked at elaboration, and the code-level analysis flags the upgrade-deadlock ANTI-PATTERN (acquiring write while holding plain read on the same resource, the case alpha exists to prevent -- recommend alpha in the finding); WRITE = read+write allowed but only on declared paths (undeclared sibling access = finding); EXCLUSIVE = write conformance PLUS every observed access provably inside the declared arbiter/lease context (join T-0694's code-level lock identification with the model-level arbiter declaration; an access path outside the arbiter fails closed). Violations are SYS errors naming the node, the declared mode, and the offending observed operation. Litmus fixtures per mode, firing and clean.

Doable's job is a clean ordered queue listing. Move the diagnostics: (1) doable emits the list only (a single summary line like 'N stale leases skipped, see frob check' is acceptable); (2) a check gate (LEASE001-style, warning tier) or the doctor reports stale leases, lease-worktree mismatches, and scope-conflict details ONCE with remediation (the lease file paths to clean); (3) log-level discipline per T-0202/T-0235 precedent -- the per-lease detail goes to DEBUG, not stdout.

Every repo's Makefile core target becomes "uv run frob natives build" -- one line, zero per-repo cache logic, upgraded by upgrading frob.

Root-cause analysis 2026-07-22: two rejects (T-0611 tree_sitter imported into the deliberately-pure _normalized.py; T-0682 the newer state must win the splice) were violations of a DESIGN INVARIANT that existed only in the implementers/reviewers head, not as a checkable property. frob already has frob:invariant anchors + INV gates. The thread: module-level design properties (this module must not import X; this comparator must be monotonic in Y; this data model must round-trip) are not being written as invariants at the point they are established, so their violation needs a human skeptic to reconstruct. Deliver: (1) a frob:invariant flavor for IMPORT/DEPENDENCY properties (module M must never import package P) checkable statically -- T-0611s exact case becomes an INV gate error, not a review catch; (2) guidance + lint (docs + a check) that a ticket ESTABLISHING a design property (a new pure module, a new ordering/comparator, a new serialization round-trip) record it as a frob:invariant in the same change; (3) seed the two known ones now: _normalized.py-no-tree_sitter and splice_ledger-newer-wins.

T-0717 shipped the shared mode-qualified capability vocabulary
(frob.vet._capability_modes: FAMILY_MODES, CAPABILITY_MODE_KINDS,
LEGACY_CAPABILITY_ALIASES, resolve_capability_kind/expand_declared_kind/
canonical_declared_kind/normalize_observed_kind) and wired it live for the
fs family only (fs.read/fs.write, WIRED_MODE_FAMILIES={"fs"}) -- the one
family the acceptance tests exercised. net.connect/net.listen,
env.read/env.write, proc.spawn, and ffi.call are DEFINED in FAMILY_MODES
but deliberately NOT exploded by expand_declared_kind/normalize_observed_
kind yet (a bare may "net" stays exactly {"net"}), because the vet
scanner has no connect/listen (or env-read/write, proc, ffi-call)
distinction to normalize observations against -- exploding the
declaration side without a matching observation side would make every
existing bare "net"/"env"/etc. declaration spuriously SYS101-stale.

Follow-up work, explicitly not done in T-0717:
1. Extend frob.vet._capability's per-language needle tables with a real
   connect-vs-listen split for net (e.g. socket.connect vs socket.bind+
   listen; net.connect vs net.listen in TS/Rust equivalents), and an
   env read-vs-write split, before adding those families to
   WIRED_MODE_FAMILIES.
2. Mechanical sweep of this repo's own design/frob.strata declarations
   and DEFAULT_BENIGN_CAPABILITIES (src/frob/strata/_threat.py) once a
   family is wired, mirroring what T-0717 did for fs (BenignCapability
   entries + CAPABILITY_KINDS registration would be needed for fs.read/
   fs.write too if any node ever declares them precisely -- currently
   design/frob.strata only uses the still-legal coarse "fs"/"fs-read"
   spellings, so this was deferred).
3. ESTATE migration (mandate point 3): once net/env/proc/ffi are wired,
   file per-repo tickets (T-0573 fleet routing) for the 8 sibling repos'
   own capability declarations to adopt the precise family.mode spellings
   ahead of the T-0717 alias sunset (fs-write/fs-read, 2026-10-20).

Disclosed by T-0818's investigation (2026-07-23): LANG003's KNOWN_GAP facet
verification requires the CHECKED repo's own ticket queue to carry the
ticket id named in frob's internal _arch_status gap table (e.g. T-0329
for typescript arch). For frob itself that id resolves; for any DOWNSTREAM
adopter repo (the 8-repo rollout) the id is meaningless -- their queues
will never mirror frob-internal ids, so every known-gap facet escalates
to ERROR on adopter repos. Adjudicate the design: (a) known-gap ids
verify against frob's own shipped registry, not the checked repo's queue;
(b) gap references become adopter-neutral (URL/registry key); or (c)
document that adopters must waive. Pick one, implement, and add an
adopter-shaped fixture test (repo with no frob-internal ids).

undocumented. Inexpressible in the single-token RIGHTS vocabulary. Pair
with the disclosed privilege-clause gap (SeImpersonate/SeDebug classes

Re-run frob check --only dup --json at the start of this ticket (do not trust this snapshot -- T-0597's own dispatch drifted 75->240 groups in one day). For each group: genuine extraction (shared logic into one home, update call sites, before/after tests, TEST016 mutant-kill check per the T-0597 dispatch playbook) or an honest full-group frob:waive DUP001/DUP002 reason if it is a false pair. Acceptance: frob check --only dup summary shows these 25 groups' fragments no longer among the unwaived (fixed-or-waived), frob-cycle stays clean, no import cycles introduced.

Re-measured 2026-07-23 by T-0597: the frob-dup check stage (frob check --only dup, the legacy find_duplicates scanner T-0597 was scoped against) currently shows 240 total groups, 110 already covered by full-group frob:waive DUP001/DUP002 directives, 130 unaccounted. Of the 130 unaccounted, 105 involve ONLY tests/** files (no src/frob/** member) -- a sibling ticket (see parent T-0597's Done/fail report) carves out the remaining 25 groups that touch src/frob/** for real extraction judgment; this ticket is the tests-only batch, which the T-0597 dispatch playbook expects to be mostly (not necessarily all) legitimate parallel-scaffolding false pairs.

Do NOT hand-copy a stale list: at the start of this ticket, run:

  uv run frob check --only dup --json

and filter diagnostics with severity=="warning" whose message contains no "src/frob" path segment -- that is the authoritative, current group list (it will have drifted again since this filing; T-0597's own dispatch saw the raw dup group count move 75->240 in about one day of concurrent landings). For each group: waive with an honest, specific, full-group frob:waive DUP001 (or DUP002) reason (T-0375's full-coverage rule -- every fragment's symref must be covered, no any-shared-symref shortcuts) if it is a coincidental structural/parallel-test-scaffolding pair, or extract into a shared test helper/fixture (with before/after test runs) if the shared logic is genuinely one thing duplicated, not parallel-but-distinct test intent. Given the volume, batch the work (e.g. by source test file or by group-size band) and commit incrementally per playbook section 12/discipline. Acceptance: frob check --only dup summary shows 0 unaccounted groups whose fragments are entirely under tests/**, no threshold loosened.

A waiver matching nothing in a full run is stale: the underlying finding was fixed or the rule changed.

T-0730 wires `collect_ts_tests`/`collect_cpp_tests` into `frob.gates._load_tests`
and retires the ts structural fallback (`_NATIVE_TEST_EXTENSIONS`) now that a real
vitest-backed node id can match a TS `frob:tests` directive's `path::name` symref
exactly.

C/C++ could not be retired in the same pass: `collect_cpp_tests`'s own docstring
discloses a KNOWN APPROXIMATION -- a ctest node id anchors to the build directory
(`<build_dir>::<test name>`), not the real source file a `frob:tests` directive
lives above, so a C/C++ directive's `src` (`tests/foo_test.cpp::TestName`) can
essentially never land in `tests.node_ids` even when the test genuinely exists
and ran. Retiring the structural fallback for C/C++ today would silently drop
ALL existing C/C++ TEST001-004 credit in any project using this gate, not
tighten it.

Real fix needs either (a) a ctest source-file mapping (e.g. parsing
`CTestTestfile.cmake` or `--show-only=json-v1`'s richer `properties` for a
`FIXTURES_SETUP`/source hint, if ctest exposes one) or (b) a different collector
for gtest-discovered cases via `--gtest_list_tests` per test binary, which does
carry real per-case names closer to source. Scoped out of T-0730 deliberately,
not silently dropped -- see T-0730's Done report.

Found while working T-0786 (gate-vacuousness sweep).

frob.lang's tree-sitter ingestion (`_parse` in src/frob/lang/__init__.py,
~line 316-370) reads the ENTIRE file into memory (`path.read_bytes()`) and
hands it to tree-sitter's `parser.parse(source)` with no file-size cap and
no parse timeout, for every file frob's graph walk visits -- including
files under an audited/untrusted repo tree (this is a general-purpose
static-analysis tool other people's repos get pointed at, not just this
one's own source). Tree-sitter's incremental-parse error recovery is
generally robust but is not immune to pathological-input classes (deeply
nested brackets/parens driving quadratic-ish recovery, or simply a
multi-GB single file) -- and there is no structural guard here at all, not
even a generous one: no `st_size` check before `read_bytes()`, no
wall-clock budget around `parser.parse()`.

Fix direction: add a configurable max-file-size guard (skip + record a
PARSE001-shaped "too large to parse" finding rather than attempt it) and a
wall-clock timeout around the tree-sitter parse call in `_parse`, so a
single adversarial or merely enormous file cannot hang or exhaust memory
in a `frob check` run over an untrusted tree.

Found while working T-0786 (gate-vacuousness sweep).

Several registry-backed gates share one "missing backing file/dir means no
claim, not a violation" posture, each independently justified in its own
docstring: `registry_gate` (REG001-011, src/frob/gates/_registry_exhaustiveness.py:812,
"if not base.is_dir(): ..."), `compliance_gate` (COMPLIANCE005,
src/frob/gates/__init__.py:7665, explicitly "matching registry_gate's own
missing-directory posture"), and `decisions_gate`'s DEC001/DEC002 half
(src/frob/gates/__init__.py:7035, "if not decisions_dir(root).exists():
return ()"). Each is individually reasonable ("a repo with no registry
makes no claim") but the aggregate effect is a real vacuousness vector none
of the three docstrings names: these YAML/markdown backing files, once a
repo HAS adopted them, become security/compliance-load-bearing artifacts
(COMPLIANCE005 in particular gates regulatory-control disposition
exhaustiveness) whose accidental or malicious DELETION is structurally
indistinguishable, to every one of these gates, from "this repo never
adopted the registry" -- both silently clear every violation the registry
existing would have produced. Nothing elsewhere in the gate catalog fires
on the deletion itself (no REF/DOC-family check treats
`docs/design/registry/compliance.yaml`'s disappearance as itself a
finding) once a repo has adopted the file.

Fix direction: for a repo that has ever adopted one of these registries
(a simple signal: the file/dir is present in the merge-base commit but
absent in the working tree, or a frob.toml flag marking the registry as
"required once adopted"), treat its disappearance as a loud, ideally
unwaivable violation rather than silently degrading to the "never adopted"
posture. Scope this ticket to at minimum COMPLIANCE005 (the
highest-stakes instance); REG*/DEC* can follow the same pattern once the
mechanism exists.

Found while working T-0786 (gate-by-gate vacuous-satisfaction sweep, round

`dup_gate` (src/frob/gates/__init__.py:8175, DUP001/DUP002) is opt-in via
`[dup].enforce = true` in frob.toml (disclosed, fine) -- but when enforce
IS on and the `frob-core` native extension is unavailable
(`core_available()` returns False), it degrades to:

    _log.warning("dup_gate: frob-core not installed; DUP rules skipped")
    return ()

a bare log warning, not a `Violation` -- so `frob check`'s exit code and
violation list are UNCHANGED whether DUP001/002 genuinely found nothing or
silently could not run at all. This repo's own playbook
(docs/guides/agent-playbook.md section 1) documents exactly this failure
mode as a REAL, recurring one: "Fresh worktrees do not inherit a sibling
worktree's build -- strata_core/frob_core come up missing" (T-0144) --
meaning a repo that has opted into `[dup].enforce=true` and then runs
`frob check` from a worktree where `make core` has not yet run gets zero
DUP001/002 enforcement, with a green gate-summary line and only a WARNING
in the logs (which the playbook's own section 3 names as something never
piped/read live in a normal `frob check` invocation).

This is the same class T-0552/TEST013 already fixed for the coverage
gate's own native-unavailable structural fallback ("make the structural-
fallback credit ... LOUD instead of silent") -- DUP never got the
equivalent treatment.

Fix direction: when `[dup].enforce=true` and `core_available()` is False,
emit a loud WARN (or ERROR)-tier Violation naming the missing native and
the remediation (`make core`), instead of a log-only degrade -- mirroring
TEST013's shape for the coverage gate.

not a new tracked field. This is a real design + implementation gap on
its own: today's `Ticket`/ledger model does not retain a transition-
history log at all (only the CURRENT `state`), so "closed-per-sprint"
needs either (a) mining git log diffs of `tickets.md` for `state: done`
transitions per commit, correlated with each ticket's `sprint` field
(landed by T-0715), or (b) a lightweight append-only transition-log this

Re-express this properly: declare a `resource tickets_ledger { lock "tickets.lock" }` (or `arbitrated_by` the CLI-writer node, whichever models T-0458/T-0633's actual single-writer-lock discipline more accurately) plus `access "tickets_ledger" mode write` on each node/store that writes it, then drop the now-superseded SYS203 waivers once the model-level arbiter discharges the contention cleanly (verify via frob.strata._access.resource_contention_violations against frob's own elaborated design). Also re-point tests/test_tickets_live_tracker.py:220's `ticket=T-0700` placeholder to this ticket's id once assigned. Blocked by nothing; T-0700 is done and closed.

T-0399's gates-quality audit (docs/audits/gates-quality.md) found the
entire quality/security-advisory surface (PERF001-004, PII010/012, SEC110,
ARCH001, DUP) is WARN-tier and non-blocking, so a green `frob check` makes
no quality claim. T-0399 executed the promotable-now slice (DUP fail-
closed behavior) and measured live warning counts per family. This epic
parents the burn-down children needed before each remaining family can be
safely promoted to ERROR without redding main.

Found while working T-0974 ("enable [dup].enforce=true by default").

`frob check`'s main run wraps its whole duration in
`derived_state_lock(root, exclusive=False)` (SHARED,
src/frob/check/__init__.py:582 and 3 other call sites). `dup_gate` (the
"clones" job) is dispatched into a `ProcessPoolExecutor`
(`_PROCESS_POOL_GATES`, src/frob/gates/__init__.py ~line 9994) for real
CPU parallelism (T-0415). `find_clones` (src/frob/dup/_pipeline.py)
unconditionally wraps its ENTIRE body in
`derived_state_write_lock(root)` (EXCLUSIVE-or-noop,
src/frob/process/_lock.py).

`derived_state_write_lock`'s reentrancy check (`_process_already_holds`,
src/frob/process/_lock.py) is a PROCESS-WIDE in-memory registry -- it only
sees state set by threads in the SAME OS process. Because "clones" runs in
a genuinely separate forked/spawned process (ProcessPoolExecutor, not
ThreadPoolExecutor), that worker's `_process_already_holds(root)` reads
False even though `frob check`'s main process already holds SHARED. The
worker then takes the real cross-process path and calls
`flock(LOCK_EX)`, which blocks forever against the main process's SHARED
hold -- and that SHARED hold cannot release until the worker (which is
itself the thing it's waiting on) returns. This is a genuine, reproducible
DEADLOCK, not merely slowness, for any `frob check` run where `[dup].
enforce=true` and the clones job actually reaches this lock (i.e. every
run, since `find_clones` takes the lock unconditionally, not just on
cache-miss).

Live repro (this ticket, 2026-07-27): set `[dup].enforce=true` (no
`native_rungs`), delete `.frob/dup.db`, run `uv run frob check --only
clones`. The run exceeded 120s/200s+ with near-zero CPU (I/O-wait, not
compute). `lslocks` showed:

```
python  <pid-worker>  FLOCK  WRITE*  ...  .frob/derived.lock   # blocked
frob    <pid-main>     FLOCK  READ    ...  .frob/derived.lock   # held
```

confirming the exact mechanism above. This likely explains T-0399's
original "~150s blowout" measurement too -- it was plausibly this
deadlock (or very close to it) rather than genuine fingerprinting compute
cost, since `derived_state_write_lock`'s own module docstring already
documents (T-0918) that its reentrancy signal only works for a
`ThreadPoolExecutor` worker THREAD nested in the main process, and
explicitly disclaims the process-pool case as a "documented latent gap,
not an observed regression" with "no current production call site" doing
this -- but `_PROCESS_POOL_GATES` including `"clones"` (T-0415, landed
separately) IS exactly that call site; the two tickets' assumptions never
got cross-checked against each other.

T-0974 could not safely flip `[dup].enforce=true` on by default given
this: doing so would make `frob check`'s clones stage hang (not just run
slow) for any cold-cache run, which is strictly worse than the status quo
(off by default, gate never runs).

Fix needs design, not a quick patch, and touches files outside T-0974's
declared scope (`src/frob/process/_lock.py` for the locking primitive
itself, and/or `src/frob/gates/__init__.py`'s `_PROCESS_POOL_GATES`
executor-topology decision, which T-0415 deliberately set for "clones").
Candidate directions (not evaluated in depth): (a) move "clones"
specifically out of `_PROCESS_POOL_GATES` back onto the thread pool --
the native Rust calls inside `find_clones` likely release the GIL enough
for real parallelism even on a thread, but this partially undoes T-0415's
reasoning for this one gate and needs re-measurement; (b) give
`derived_state_write_lock` a real cross-process-but-same-run reentrancy
signal (e.g. a marker file/env var the parent `frob check` process sets
before spawning its ProcessPoolExecutor workers, checked by
`_process_already_holds` in addition to the in-memory registry); (c) have
`frob check`'s main process release its SHARED hold (or downgrade some
other way) before submitting process-pool jobs that might need the
EXCLUSIVE path, and reacquire after -- correctness-sensitive, needs care
against the exact race T-0918's docstring already warns about for the
thread case.

Scope for the ticket that picks this up: `src/frob/process/_lock.py`,
`src/frob/gates/__init__.py` (`_PROCESS_POOL_GATES`, `dup_gate`
dispatch), plus `docs/modules/process.md`/`docs/modules/gates.md` for the
corrected reentrancy-contract writeup once fixed.

T-0988's repo-wide frob fmt recompaction touched these test files' surrounding frob: directive comments (no test-body changes), which surfaced 2 pre-existing DUP001 findings: tests/test_tickets_scope_mutation.py::TestScopeCli.test_cli_requires_reason (100% similar to tests/unit/test_ticket_file_flags.py::TestScopeReasonFile.test_neither_reason_nor_reason_file_errors_cleanly), and tests/test_evidence_integrity.py::TestD02ScopeBinding.test_transition_allows_when_covers_scope_true (95% similar to tests/test_evidence_integrity.py::TestT0417ReverifyEvidenceOnClose.test_transition_allows_when_evidence_reverified_true). Confirmed pre-existing and unrelated to the fmt diff itself (the flagged test bodies are unchanged; DUP001 compares a touched file's symbols against the whole corpus regardless of what changed about them). Extract a shared helper or otherwise dedup, per the gate's own suggestion, in a follow-up -- out of scope for a purely mechanical fmt ticket to fix opportunistically.

Found while working T-0997 (coverage pipeline fix): a real, fresh `make
coverage` run in a clean worktree (merged to main tip) shows ~118 test
failures that are NOT caused by coverage instrumentation -- reproduced
several individually WITHOUT --cov and they still fail (e.g.
tests/test_registry_reconciliation_patterns.py::TestExhaustivenessGateOverRealPatterns::test_no_patterns_violations,
tests/test_ticket_land.py::TestLand::test_dry_run_lands_cleanly_and_leaves_no_trace,
tests/system/test_cli_check.py::TestGitlessTargetGateSeverity::test_render_lint_gate_warns_not_errors_on_gitless_root).
These span registry-reconciliation exhaustiveness self-checks
(patterns/compliance/secrets/supply_chain/weaknesses/system_design all
report real violations against this worktree's live tickets.md/registry
state), ticket-land/evidence-enforcement system tests, and a handful of
CLI system tests. Because pytest exits non-zero, `make coverage`'s
Makefile recipe halts before its own `coverage combine`/`coverage xml`/
`frob check --stamp-coverage` lines run, so a fresh `make coverage`
currently requires a manual combine/xml/stamp workaround to get any
numbers at all -- and the failing subprocess-heavy system tests never
contribute their coverage, capping how far `join_fraction` can rise
(0.49 observed vs T-0997's target of "well above 0.34"; a green suite
would likely push it meaningfully higher). Needs triage: some of these
may be genuine registry drift in this worktree's ticket state (dozens of
concurrent worktree agents landing tickets) rather than a real product
bug; others (the gitless-target severity assertion, the render-lint
stderr-vs-logging-capture mismatch) look like real, fixable test/gate
bugs. Scope was deliberately not widened to fix these under T-0997.

T-0992 added the land-side monotonicity backstop and it has now correctly REFUSED a third stale-bump attempt (T-0997 land computed 0.183.0 vs main 0.184.0). But the producer bug remains: _apply_release_bump_for_land derives its baseline from the worktree-carried release manifest/pyproject that rode the squash. Fix the callback to read the baseline from ROOT current state (same git-show technique as the guard) so the guard becomes a never-fires invariant instead of a per-land speed bump requiring a manual worktree merge. Churn-epic member: each guard refusal costs a merge+reland round trip.

```
`frob.graph.callgraph.scope_private_helper_gaps` (T-0998, SCOPE002
direction 5) narrows its `build_call_graph` candidate set to files sharing
a scoped file's PARENT DIRECTORY. For a flat top-level directory like
`tests/` (hundreds of files, one dir), this degrades to "every test file
in the whole tests/ tree" the moment any single test file is in scope --
observed live: scoping `tests/test_graph.py` alone produced 4000+ SCOPE002
"review the dependency" findings, almost all naming a same-named `_write`/
`_run` helper private to some unrelated sibling test file, not a real
under-capture signal.

WARN-only (never blocks), so this is noise, not a correctness bug -- but
noisy enough that a real agent would tune it out entirely rather than
read the real hits buried in it. Needs a narrower per-scope candidate-set
heuristic for large flat directories (e.g. cap candidate file count, or
require the SAME leaf-name collision to be genuinely ambiguous before
flagging, or scope the search to files matching the ticket's own SOURCE
directory conventions rather than a raw parent-dir match) before this
direction is trustworthy enough to read routinely. Filed instead of fixed
under T-0998's own scope/effort budget.

Follow-up to T-1015 (DOC006 doc-pointer burn-down, round 1): after
matcher hardening (directory-prefix + suffix FILE/PATH resolution,
enumeration-list/domain-citation shape rejection, multi-manifest CONFIG
REFERENCE resolution against pyproject.toml/Cargo.toml, `.git/`-path
exemption, and a tickets-archive.md verbatim-ledger exclusion) plus a
handful of targeted illustrative-example waivers, DOC006 findings measured
771 -> 131 (see T-1015's Done report for the full before/after
cluster table).

The remaining 131 findings are fragmented across ~30 doc files with no
single dominant cluster left (round-1's own measurement, `--only docblocks
--json`, 62 config reference / 30 file/path / 20 code symbol / 13
doc-anchor link / 9 cli invocation). Largest remaining single files:
docs/modules/vet.md (16), docs/modules/gates.md (12), docs/modules/perf.md
(8), CHANGELOG.md (7), docs/strata/threat.md (6). Work this ticket by:

1. Re-measure with a fresh chunked `frob check --only docblocks --json`
   (counts may have drifted since round 1).
2. For each remaining finding, determine per-file/per-line whether it is:
   - a genuinely stale doc pointer (fix the doc prose to the current
     path/symbol/config key), or
   - a further matcher false-positive class worth generalizing (check for
     new clusters before assuming everything left is genuine drift), or
   - a genuinely external/illustrative pointer (a nearby `frob:waive
     DOC006 reason="..."`).
3. Re-check promotion (WARN -> ERROR) once the live count is near zero;
   record the decision with count evidence in docs/audits/gates-quality.md
   under the DOC006 section T-1015 added.
