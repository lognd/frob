# frob.gates -- enforcement gates, policy, and invariants

One sentence: the checks that join the obligation graph, the ticket queue,
docs, and policy rules, and turn every unaccounted-for change -- and every
unaccounted-for *absence* of change -- into a `frob check` failure.

Two enforcement halves (see `docs/rework.md`): the drift half (nothing
declared is silently broken) and the coverage half (nothing new escapes
declaration).

## Rule catalog

| Rule | Gate | Fails when |
|---|---|---|
| DRIFT001 | drift | acked digest moved without re-ack (`frob ack`) |
| DRIFT002 | drift | edge endpoint no longer resolves (rename/delete) |
| COV001 | coverage | public symbol has no `doc` edge (docstring counts via `doc` facet only if policy says so) |
| COV002 | coverage | diff hunk touches a symbol with no `frob:ticket` edge to an open ticket |
| COV003 | coverage | ticket in state done with evidence ids that do not resolve to collected tests |
| COV004 | coverage | attachment sha256 mismatch or file missing |
| TODO001 | coverage | `frob:todo` (or bare TODO/FIXME comment) not bound to an open ticket |
| SCOPE001 | scope | diff touches paths/symbols outside the active ticket's `scope` |
| PRE001 | pre-work | ticket moved to in-progress without a recorded pre-work sweep |
| INV001 | invariant | invariant has no evidence (test or policy rule) |
| INV002 | invariant | invariant has no code anchor (`frob:invariant`) |
| TEST001 | test | public function/method has no `frob:tests` unit edge |
| TEST002 | test | unit edges for a symbol number fewer than `min_unit_cases` |
| TEST003 | test | interface (package whose public symbols are imported by another package) has fewer than `min_integration` integration edges |
| TEST004 | test | declared system has fewer than its `min_e2e` e2e edges |
| TEST005 | test | measured coverage below threshold (per-symbol branch, per-module line, or per-system line) |
| TEST006 | test | coverage evidence missing, or stale against current file hashes |
| DOC001 | doclink | a doc file matching `[gates.docs] include` globs (default `docs/**/*.md` -- new files auto-obligated) has no frob:describes anchor, no frob:doc edge into it, and is unreachable via markdown links from the roots (docs/index.md, README.md) |
| POL* | policy | user-defined rules from `frob.toml` (see below) |

Severity: `error` (exit 1) or `warn`; per-rule default overridable via the
`[gates.severity]` table in `frob.toml` (`COV001 = "warn"`), applied as a
single post-processing step in `run_gates` -- the legacy-adoption dial. Any rule is waivable at a site via
`frob:waive RULE-ID reason="..."`; waivers are listed in every report, so a
waiver is visible debt, never silence.

## Invariants

"Proving things that matter": an invariant is a tracked statement whose
truth must have standing evidence. Files in `invariants/INV-###.md`:

```markdown
---
id: INV-007
statement: Lock writes are atomic; a crashed frob never truncates frob.lock
criticality: high             # high|medium
evidence:
  - tests/test_lock.py::test_write_atomic_under_kill   # pytest node id
  - POL-no-direct-lock-write                            # or a policy rule id
---
Rationale and threat model prose here.
```

INV001/INV002 close the loop: every invariant is anchored in code
(`frob:invariant INV-007` at the enforcing site) and backed by evidence
that `frob check` verifies still exists (test collected, rule loaded).
Security work becomes monotonic: each audit finding lands as an invariant
plus a policy rule or property test, never a one-off fix.

## Policy rules (`frob.toml`, `[policy]`)

```toml
[[policy.forbidden-import]]
id = "POL-no-requests-in-core"
module = "requests"
within = "src/frob/graph/**"
reason = "graph must stay offline-pure"

[[policy.pattern]]
id = "POL-no-subprocess-shell"
language = "python"
query = "(call ...)"          # tree-sitter query, file in policy/queries/
severity = "error"

[[policy.norm]]
id = "POL-max-diff-lines"
max_diff_lines = 400          # per active ticket; restraint merges
```

Three rule kinds at alpha: `forbidden-import`, `pattern` (tree-sitter query
over `frob.lang` trees), and `norm` (diff-shape rules). Taint analysis is
explicitly out of scope for 0.1.0.

## Test obligations (`frob.toml`, `[testing]` and `[[system]]`)

```toml
[testing]
min_unit_cases = 3            # TEST002: unit edges per public symbol
min_integration = 1           # TEST003: integration edges per interface
unit_branch_cov = 90          # TEST005: per-symbol branch coverage floor
module_line_cov = 85          # TEST005: per-module line coverage floor
system_line_cov = 80          # TEST005: per-system line coverage floor

[[system]]
id = "cli-check"              # target of frob:tests <id> kind="e2e"
entrypoint = "frob check"     # documentation; e2e tests drive it via subprocess
min_e2e = 5                   # TEST004
paths = ["src/frob/check/**", "src/frob/gates/**"]   # system_line_cov scope
```

Binding is explicit: a test declares what it tests via `frob:tests`
directives (see docs/graph.md); the gate verifies the declared node ids are
actually collected by pytest, so a deleted test cannot keep satisfying an
obligation. Coverage is recorded evidence: `make coverage` runs pytest-cov
then `stamp_coverage`; `frob check` only reads the stamp and coverage.xml.
A stale or missing stamp is itself a violation (TEST006) -- the gate never
silently passes because tests were not run.

## Data models

```python
class Violation(BaseModel):
    rule: str                   # "DRIFT001", "POL-..."
    severity: Severity          # ERROR | WARN
    file: str
    line: int
    message: str                # human sentence incl. the fix command
    waived: WaiverRef | None    # populated when a frob:waive matched

class GateReport(BaseModel):
    violations: tuple[Violation, ...]
    waived: tuple[Violation, ...]
    stats: GateStats            # counts per gate, timing per gate

class GateConfig(BaseModel):
    root: Path
    base: str = "main"
    ticket: str | None = None   # explicit --ticket
    gates: frozenset[str]       # subset selection for frob check --only

class Diff(BaseModel):
    base: str
    hunks: tuple[Hunk, ...]     # file, span, touched symrefs (resolved
                                # against the snapshot by frob.gates)

class PreworkSweep(BaseModel):
    date: date
    dup_findings: int
    xref_hits: tuple[str, ...]
    digest: str                 # over scope file hashes at sweep time

    id: str                     # ^INV-\d{3}$
    statement: str
    criticality: Criticality
    evidence: tuple[str, ...]

class CollectedTests(BaseModel):
    node_ids: frozenset[str]    # from pytest --collect-only -q, cached

class SystemSpec(BaseModel):
    id: str
    entrypoint: str
    min_e2e: int
    paths: tuple[str, ...]

class TestPolicy(BaseModel):    # [testing] table, all floors overridable
    min_unit_cases: int = 3
    min_integration: int = 1
    unit_branch_cov: int = 90
    module_line_cov: int = 85
    system_line_cov: int = 80

class CoverageData(BaseModel):
    source_sha: str             # coverage.xml sha recorded by the stamp
    symbol_branch: Mapping[str, float]   # symref -> percent
    module_line: Mapping[str, float]     # package path -> percent
```

## Error types

```python
class GateError(ErrorSet):
    GraphUnavailable = "Graph build failed; gates cannot run"
    GitFailed        = "git diff/merge-base failed"
    NoTicketContext  = "Scope gate requested but no active ticket resolved"

class PolicyError(ErrorSet):
    MalformedRule = "Policy rule failed schema validation"
    BadQuery      = "tree-sitter query does not compile"

class InvariantError(ErrorSet):
    Malformed   = "Invariant file failed schema validation"
    DuplicateId = "Two invariant files share an id"

class CoverageError(ErrorSet):
    Missing  = "No coverage.xml/stamp found; run make coverage"
    Malformed = "coverage.xml could not be parsed"
```

## Design decisions

- **Gates are pure functions over loaded state.** Load once (snapshot,
  queue, lock, diff, tests), run gates in parallel via the existing check
  ThreadPoolExecutor. No gate does IO; `run_gates` owns all loading.
- **Ticket context is optional; scope/pre-work gates degrade to skipped,
  not failed**, when no ticket resolves -- humans doing exploratory work on
  main are not fighting the tool. COV002 still catches unticketed diffs at
  check time, so nothing escapes; it just fails later rather than louder.
- **Every violation message embeds its remedy** ("run: frob ack <ref>",
  "run: frob ticket new ..."). Agents act on messages; a message without a
  next command is a dead end.
- **Waivers are per-site, reasoned, and reported.** Global rule disabling
  requires editing `frob.toml` in a reviewed commit.
- **Bare TODO/FIXME comments are violations** (TODO001). The habit the
  system replaces must not survive alongside it.
- **pytest collection is the evidence oracle** for test node ids, cached in
  `.frob/` keyed on test-file hashes; running tests is `make test`'s job,
  existence is the gate's job.
- **Test obligations verify existence, quantity, and measured reach -- not
  quality.** Counts and coverage floors are gameable proxies (assert-free
  tests pass them); the honest quality oracle is mutation testing, which is
  deferred post-0.1.0 and recorded in TODO.md. A `pattern` policy rule
  banning assert-free test functions ships as a first defense.
- **Interfaces are derived, not declared.** Any package whose public
  symbols another package imports owes integration tests; deriving this
  from the graph means a new boundary cannot be forgotten. Pair-level
  (consumer x provider) strictness is deferred; per-provider at alpha.
- **Coverage thresholds are floors in config, not goals in prose.**
  Raising a floor is a reviewed `frob.toml` commit; lowering one is too,
  and shows up in diff review.

## Dependencies

- `frob.graph` (snapshot, lock, drift), `frob.tickets` (queue),
  `frob.policy`, `frob.lang` (pattern queries).
- git via subprocess (diff, merge-base, branch name).
- `pydantic`, `typani`.

## Integration points

- `frob.check`: `run_check` gains a gates stage; `frob check --only gates`,
  `--ticket T-0042`, `--base <ref>` flags; exit code folds into the
  existing errors-first report and `frob parse` output format.
- `frob ticket start` calls `record_prework` (dup + xref over scope).
- Pre-commit hook and CI both run `frob check`; agents run it after every
  ticket before writing a done-report.

## Phase 4 implementation notes (deviations from the design above)

The design above is otherwise as-implemented. The following are the
concrete choices made where the design was ambiguous or where a
dependency's real API did not match the sketch:

- **`WAIVE001` is derived from `GraphSnapshot.malformed`, not a separate
  scan.** `frob.graph.dsl.parse_directives` already refuses to turn a
  `frob:waive` directive lacking `reason="..."` into an `Edge` -- it
  becomes a `MalformedDirective` instead. `gates._waive001_violations`
  simply surfaces any malformed directive whose reason text mentions
  `frob:waive`. Every `Edge` with `kind == WAIVE` that reaches a gate is
  therefore guaranteed to already carry a `reason` attr.
- **`prework_gate` takes an extra `sweep: Option[PreworkSweep] = Nothing()`
  argument** beyond the doc's `(ticket, snapshot)` signature. The sweep is
  loaded state (see below) and gates must not do IO, so `run_gates` loads
  it via `gates._prework.load_prework` and passes it in.
- **`invariant_gate` takes an extra `policy_rule_ids: frozenset[str] =
  frozenset()` argument** beyond `(invariants, snapshot, tests)`, so
  INV001 can treat a loaded policy rule id as valid evidence (the doc's
  own example evidence list includes `POL-no-direct-lock-write`); without
  it the pure function would have no way to see policy state.
- **`record_prework` storage**: `frob.tickets` exposes only
  `record_failure` (a fixed "## Failure log" section), not a generic
  body-section appender, and growing `frob.tickets`'s public surface is
  out of scope for this phase. The sweep is instead stored as JSON at
  `.frob/prework/<ticket_id>.json` (`gates/_prework.py`), read back by
  `load_prework`. `PRE001` compares `sweep.digest` against a fresh
  `_scope_digest(ticket, snapshot)` (sha256 over the ticket's scope-glob-
  matched `snapshot.file_hashes` entries).
- **Hunk-to-symref resolution is reimplemented in `gates`**, not imported
  from `frob.testing._select`: `select_tests` does the same span-overlap
  match inline as part of a larger algorithm and never exposes it as a
  standalone function. `gates._touched_symrefs`/`_touched_files` are a
  documented duplicate of that overlap primitive, same posture as the
  extension-table duplicates already accepted across
  `frob.graph`/`frob.testing`/`frob.policy`.
- **TEST003 interface derivation, alpha semantics**: the graph has no
  cross-file import edges (only `frob:` directive edges and doc anchors),
  so real "package A's public symbols imported by package B" derivation
  is not available. Alpha instead treats every `src/<pkg>/<subpkg>`
  directory containing at least one public, non-test symbol as an
  interface owing `min_integration` integration `frob:tests` edges -- the
  simple, honest over-approximation the design's own "Interfaces are
  derived, not declared" note anticipates. Pair-level (consumer x
  provider) strictness is deferred.
- **TEST001/TEST002/TEST005 skip symbols in test files themselves**
  (`gates._is_test_file`, a documented duplicate of
  `frob.testing._select._is_test_file`'s heuristic) -- a public `test_*`
  function does not owe itself a unit test.
- **TEST005 system floor** is approximated as the mean of `module_line`
  percentages for files matching any of `[[system]].paths`, since
  `CoverageData` (per the doc's own model) has no separate per-system
  map; `load_coverage` only ever produces `symbol_branch`/`module_line`.
- **`frob.gates` does not re-export `PolicyRule`/`PolicyError`/
  `load_policy`/`policy_gate`.** `frob.policy` imports `Violation`/
  `Severity`/`WaiverRef` from `frob.gates._models`, so a module-level
  `from frob.policy import ...` in `frob.gates.__init__` would form an
  import cycle the first time either package is imported standalone.
  `run_gates` imports `load_policy`/`policy_gate` lazily inside its own
  body instead; callers needing policy types import them from
  `frob.policy` directly.
- **`policy_gate`'s `forbidden-import` and `pattern` rules read file
  content off disk via `Path(snapshot.root)`** plus
  `snapshot.file_hashes` (for glob-matched file listing), since the
  signature `policy_gate(rules, snapshot, diff)` carries no separate
  root parameter; `GraphSnapshot.root` already carries it.
- **`GateError` collapses every loading failure** (`frob.graph`,
  `frob.graph.lock`, `frob.tickets`, `frob.gates.invariants`,
  `frob.policy`) into one of `GraphUnavailable` / `QueueUnavailable` /
  `ConfigMalformed` / `GitFailed` / `WriteFailed`, rather than a full
  `GraphError | LockError | TicketError | InvariantError | PolicyError`
  union, to keep `run_gates`'s `Result[GateReport, GateError]` a single
  small enum callers can match on directly.
- **Severity defaults per rule** are fixed in code (`ERROR` for
  DRIFT/COV002-004/SCOPE001/PRE001/INV001-002/TEST001/TEST004/WAIVE001/
  policy rules with no `severity` override; `WARN` for COV001, TODO001,
  TEST002/003/005). Per-rule severity overrides in `frob.toml` were
  scoped out of this phase; `PolicyRule.severity` is the only
  user-configurable severity today (via `[[policy.*]].severity`).
